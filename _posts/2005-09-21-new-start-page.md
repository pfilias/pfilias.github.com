My friend, Bob, at work, showed me Start.com today. It's Microsoft's attempt at making a sleeker portal (start) page. I think they're getting some design cues/competition from Google's no-nonsense approach to bringing us all we need without graphics. I have to say, start.com is pretty damn cool. Works great in Firefox, which they've noted is on their agenda in terms of not forgetting about their firefox users.

<blockquote>Here are some of the things we're currently working on:

    * Firefox support
      rest assured we haven't abandoned our firefox users and are working on the issues continuously
    * OPML import/export
      yes, we have this in our previous versions and we'll be adding it to myw3b soon... we've just got a few loose ends to tie up with the user experience
    * better default experience
    * drag/drop management of the sidebar and folder creation
    * import your favorites/bookmarks
    * roaming
    * UI fit and finish</blockquote>

What's funny is that they use a lowercase "f" for firefox in their sentence about Firefox support. Kind of like when some people I know use god instead of God. =)

Anyway, check it out.

Heh, just as I clicked my own Technorati start.com tag to see what others have said about start.com, I find out that Google has their own personalized start page!
