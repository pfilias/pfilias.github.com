Tortilla Man sent this good one along!

<b>DAMN CHECKING ACCOUNT</b>

A crusty old man walks into a bank and says to the woman at the window,
"I want to open a damn checking account."

The astonished woman replies, "I beg your pardon, sir. I must have
misunderstood you. What did you say?"

"Listen up, damn it. I said I want to open a damn checking account now!"

"I'm very sorry sir, but that kind of language is not tolerated in this
bank." The teller leaves the window and goes over to the bank manager to
inform him of her situation. The manager agrees that the teller does not
have to listen to that foul language. They both return to the window and
the manager asks the old geezer, "Sir, what seems to be the problem
here?"

"There is no damn problem," the man says. "I just won $200 million bucks
in the damn lottery and I want to put my damn money in this damn bank."

"I see," says the manager, "and is this bitch giving you a hard time?"
