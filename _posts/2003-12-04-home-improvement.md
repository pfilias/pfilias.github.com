It seems to never end. The little project, to redo the laundry room is <b>ALMOST</b> compete! One of the doors seemed a bit off, for our new cabinets, as well as my drill bit being a bit too dull to cut through it and splintering the nasty particle board. So, another $7.20 on a cabinet door won't hurt, as well as an aerator for the new washtub. Now I see how the Depot becomes a man's best friend.
