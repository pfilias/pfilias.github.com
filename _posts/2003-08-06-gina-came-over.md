<b>Gina:</b>
Gina came by to pick up a tent, sleeping bag, and tarp for the big camping weekend at The Pinery in Ontario, Canada. She goes there each and every summer with all of her friends. The coolest thing about it is that she gets to hang out with our older brother, <a href="http://www.dinofilias.com">Dino</a>.

<b>Running:</b>
Did another very nice 7 mile run tonight. Did it in 1:02:02, about 9 seconds faster than last Wednesday's run. Also, did the last mile in 7:38, which was a great effort, if I do say so myself! :)
