<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I was trying to configure Pidgin on my Ubuntu build at work, but the general help Google offers via their Help site doesn't work. You have to go to the Advanced Tab when adding your Google Apps Talk account and set the connect server to <strong>talk.google.com</strong>. You might as well change the file transfer proxies setting to <strong>talk.google.com</strong> as well. See attached.<img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-10-22/bqkvCbwJvBqnoFisngIDAkCszEiuyAnklrAoCwxfyldAdJzIAhnijJrntmjy/google_talk_apps.png.scaled500.png" width="385" height="541"/> </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p></div>
