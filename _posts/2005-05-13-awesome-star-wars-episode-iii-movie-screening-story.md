My friend, Mike, sent me this link. It's about a guy who works for Lucas or Industrial Light and Magic and went to the employee screening of SWE3:ROTS. He was in the company of some pretty important people in the movie business. You don't need to read the whole article, as most of the important information is either <b>bolded </b>or colored in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>.
