It's been fun so far. I can't complain. Taking care of this little guy is just as rewarding as people say it should be. I just gave him a bath today, sponge-style, solo. It was a bit hectic, as he was pretty upset about it the whole time. However, after dressing him back up in some new duds, he's a-ok and snoozing away in his little Baby Papasan chair. I'm sitting here at the table eating lunch, watching Jeopardy, and looking over my left shoulder, enjoying every little breath Benjamin takes! I love him!
