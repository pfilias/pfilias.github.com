Michelle and I saw <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/incredibles/intro.html">The Incredibles</a> last night. What an awesome movie. It was everything I expected it to be. Funny, clever, high-tech (animation and computer graphics), and packed full of action!

If you are at all interested in <a href="http://pixar.com">Pixar</a> movies or superhero movies, this is the perfect balance of both!!! I left the movie feeling extremely entertained and wanting to defeat bad guys. Even Michelle was pretty fired up about the movie!!! We highly recommend it.
