A nice chance for Benjamin and Angelina to get to hang out! Not only that, but we also got to hang out with Dino and Danielle. Dino was showing off his new theater components. I went over there this past weekend, Sunday, to help Dino finish the job, by crawling in his attic to help him install his surround sound speakers.

Boy, it sure was dusty up there!!
