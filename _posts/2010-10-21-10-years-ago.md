<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>10 years ago today, right around now, I was at my mom and dad's house with my groomsmen, aunts, and uncle. Sadly, my visiting aunts and uncle have since passed on, but I'll never forget them coming here for the first and only time in their lives. <img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-10-21/GBCCCgnqDpjEngdgqApFctCpbFgrnIguoJgqJEiiuenptCfzEpesBakIpdii/100111923_6b31126c051.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="334"/> </p>  <p>We were laughing, getting tuxedos on, drinking mimosas, and eating some Greek pastries. I was so excited. I've wanted to marry Michelle since damn near the time I met her in Junior High School. And on this day, that was happening. Thank you Michelle, for giving me 10 great years and 2 beautiful boys.</p>  <p><img src="http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2010-10-21/mEbdqGadomteeuarGBtgumIlkGsBsCbmdFsoJbkratmovFrojJdnnqsqechD/100111987_a19803e9e91.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" height="330"/> </p></div>
