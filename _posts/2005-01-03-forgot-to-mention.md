On our way back from the wedding, I got pulled over, about 1/2 mile from our house. I sped through a light that was turning yellow, and I even thought: "It's dark, I hope there are no coppers around." Anyway, 1/2 mile up the road from the intersection I sped through, and 1/2 mile from home, I got pulled over.

Copper: Good evening. Know why I pulled you over? Where do you live?
Me: No. Just coming back from a weekend in Green Bay. I live right around the corner, in Spring Hill.
Copper: That light was <font color="#FF0000"><b>red</b></font>.
Me: I thought it was <font color="#FFFF00"><b>yellow</b></font>. I didn't want to skid through it. (It was raining, and near <font color="#00FFFF">freezing</font>).
Copper: Had anything to drink tonight.
Me: No. On our way back from Green Bay, like I said earlier.
Copper: How's your driving record.
Me: Good. I think 1 ticket in the past 2 or 3 years.
Copper: Okay. License and registration...
... Copper comes back.
Copper: You actually have 4 points. I'm more concerned about drunk drivers. Go home.

Phew!
