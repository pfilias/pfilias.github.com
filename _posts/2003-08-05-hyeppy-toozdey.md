<b>Set a record for 1 mile:</b>
So, I felt good today, had two days or rest instead of the normal one day or zero days of rest. Mile 1 to 2 was my best 1 mile performance, ever! I did it at 9 miles per hour, 6:40! Yippee! I really need to kick up my long runs up a notch. The long runs have been kind of weak since the 12 miler w/ Kapla!
