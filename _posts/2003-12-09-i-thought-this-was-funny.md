I was just playing around with Ars Technica's forum and found this image. Made me giggle and made me want to share this with everyone else.

It's also how crazy I feel about this class we have. It's seems like it's never ending because the professor's lectures are 3 hours each and every week. It seems that our other online class we had a few months back was much easier to deal with in terms of watching the lectures... oh well, less than a week to go!
