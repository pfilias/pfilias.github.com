I think I forgot to mention a funny story.

When Michelle and I were about to head to Sedona/Flagstaff/Grand Canyon, I locked the keys in the car, while it was running. After trying for about :30, I couldn't get the doors unlocked or the windows rolled down. I called AAA and they were sending a truck to get the car opened up for me. While waiting, however, I finally managed to get the coat hanger "just right". I was able to push the window down button a few times to get the window down. Funny, but it wasted an hour. Nevertheless, we had a great time up there, and in the Phoenix area!
