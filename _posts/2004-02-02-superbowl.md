YIPPEE!!! I bet a few bucks on the Carolina Panthers and they COVERED! I actually wanted them to win, but I'm happy.

I also found out that my buddy, JT$, bought me a few Super Bowl squares for my birthday! Well, I had 0-0 and won the first quarter! $100 for me! Yipee!! Thanks, BORING TEAMS (through the 1st quarter).
