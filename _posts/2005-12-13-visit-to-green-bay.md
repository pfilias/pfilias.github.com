Well, I've put up some photos from our trip to Green Bay this past weekend. I want to point out how thankful we are to the Pappas family (name has been disguised to protect the innocent) for providing us with such RIDICULOUS seats for the game:

Thanks again to Dave and Sarah for hosting us with such nice amenities. Pappas and Fries, thanks for everything, as well! Doors, thanks for the SUV! We don't need no steenkin' fuel economy!!!
