Fiber to the Premises!

I took this from a Verizon press release.

<b>Maximum connection speeds and pricing for Fios consumer services are:
     *  5 Mbps/2 Mbps for $34.95 a month as part of a calling package, or
        $39.95 a month stand-alone
     *  15 Mbps/2 Mbps for $44.95 a month as part of a calling package, or
        $49.95 a month stand-alone
     *  30 Mbps/5 Mbps at pricing to be announced later</b>

Would that not rock? To have a 30Mbps downstream and 5Mbps upstream connection for probably 60 bux a month? FANTASTIC!!!

This is being tested in Keller, Texas, at first. The future looks bright!
