There is an excellent production out there about "The Scene" of releasing movies before they come out to DVD. You can find the shows and other information here: <a href="http://www.welcometothescene.com">Welcome to the Scene</a>.

I have watched the first two episodes, and man, I think they are awesome! I had problems downloading epis 3-5, as the Web Links (direct link to AVI files) didn't work. There are other links for some modern file-sharing internet protocols like Magnet, and bittorrent, but I don't have those installed at work and didn't want to. People use these all the time, so it shouldn't be a problem. I don't know much about them, but I don't think it's like installed Kazza, Limewire, or WinMX. I think it's more of a browser-based thing, but again, I'm not sure. Enjoy. And comment on what you think about these shows. I thought the first two were fascinating!
