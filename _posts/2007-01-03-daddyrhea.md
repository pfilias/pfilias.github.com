On New Year's Day, I was changing Benjamin at my mom's house and I announced to Michelle, across the room, that Benjamin had diarrhea. A few minutes later, when Ben was back in the living room, playing with everyone, including his cousin, Angelina, he was yelling out, "Daddyrhea, daddyrhea!". A few minutes later, he says, "Mommyrhea!".

I could've died...it was so hilarious and an awesome climax to the 13 days off I had with him and Michelle over the holidays. I fell in love with the little man.
