This comes from my friend, Geeta, at work:

<i>In the hospital the relatives gathered in the waiting room, where their 
family member lay gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came looking tired 
and somber. "I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news," he said as he 
surveyed the worried faces. "The only hope left for your loved one at 
this time is a brain transplant. It's an experimental procedure, very 
risky but it is the only hope." "Insurance will cover the procedure, 
but you will have to pay for the brain yourselves." The family members 
sat silent as they absorbed the news. After a great length of time, 
someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?" The doctor quickly 
responded, "$5,000 for a male brain, and $200 for a female brain." The 
moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile avoiding eye 
contact with the women, but some actually smirked. A man, unable to 
control his curiosity, blurted out the question everyone wanted to ask, 
"Why is the male brain so much more?" The doctor smiled at the childish 
innocence, and explained to the entire group, "It's just standard 
pricing procedure. We have to mark down the price of the female brains, 
because they've actually been used."
