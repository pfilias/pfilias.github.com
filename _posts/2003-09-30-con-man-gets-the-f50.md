I can't believe this!!! All it took was a guy in fancy attire and a slick tongue to con this dealership out of a $700k Ferrari F50. Man... what a shame. I bet after this story breaks nationwide, car salesmen and women will think twice about letting some shister get behind the wheel of anything less than a Chevy Malibu!
