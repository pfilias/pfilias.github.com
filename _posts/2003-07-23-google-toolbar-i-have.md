<a href="http://toolbar.google.com/index-beta.php">Google Toolbar</a> -- I have to be an evangelist about this toolbar from Google. This latest incantation of it, in its beta stage, is awesome! It has a built in popup blocker, Auto Fill (for forms), Blog This (which is how I did this one), and a few other neat gizmos. Get it, use it, love it. <b>How can't you LOVE GOOGLE?</b>
