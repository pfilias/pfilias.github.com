I am trying a new service that Eric showed me today. You can tie a bunch of different services to an IM account, which acts like a robot, allowing you to edit things like your blog, Google Calendar, Basecamp, etc. You can find more information at <a href="http://www.imified.com">www.imified.com</a>.
