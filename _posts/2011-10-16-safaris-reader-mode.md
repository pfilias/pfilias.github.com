So, I was looking at some of the new features of iOS 5 the other day, and came across the reader mode of Safari on my phone (the iPhone 4S). It takes all the crap out of the site you're reading and gives you just the content. So far, it's worked 100% of the time for me (2 for 2). I decided to give it a try on the PC version of Safari, reading an review of iOS 5 from Ars Technica's Jacqui Cheng.

This is how reader mode looks:

<!-- copy and paste. Modify height and width if desired. --> <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/pfilias/folders/Snagit/media/5d570579-aab9-4ea1-b24a-e1c31f227e45/10.16.2011-09.59.57.png"><img class="embeddedObject" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/pfilias/folders/Snagit/media/5d570579-aab9-4ea1-b24a-e1c31f227e45/10.16.2011-09.59.57.png" width="1001" height="743" border="0" /></a>
