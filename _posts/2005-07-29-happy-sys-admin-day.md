Alex sent this along...it's funny!

<a href="http://sysadminday.com/">System Administrator's Appreciation Day</a>

In essence, I'm the system administrator of our webserver (<a href="http://filias.com">Filias Consulting</a>) as well as a system administrator for some servers at work (Instant Messaging and Video Conferencing).
