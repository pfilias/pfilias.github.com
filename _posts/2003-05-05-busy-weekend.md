<b>What a very busy weekend we had!!!</b>
Friday night, we saw <b>X-Men 2</b>. Very exciting movie, but we saw it at 10:15, and for some reason, I went back to my form of falling asleep periodicially when watching movies late at night. It's been quite a while since I've succomed to this, but I did. Michelle kept nudging me the entire time. I felt bad for her, as I know it took away a bit of her enjoyment!

Saturday, we went <a href="http://www.filias.com/cgi-bin/album.pl?album=2003%20Albums/05.03.2003.Eggy'sFarm">horseback riding </a>at Steve's! It was an awesome experience! We rode the horses for 4 miles... took about 45 minutes or so, I'd say, maybe even longer. It took quite a bit of time to get "used" to the horse and how to control it. Man, these Arabian horses were about 1/2 second away from busting out into a gallop at any given moment. You constantly had to be aware of this and be ready to pull back on the reins and say <b>"Whoa!"</b>. It was fantastic. At the end of the day, I got mine to go into a canter, which was just fast enough to have my hat fly off my head. What a rush!!! These animals are breathtaking and powerful! I can't wait to do it again!

Sunday, we <a href="http://www.filias.com/cgi-bin/album.pl?album=2003%20Albums/05.04.2003.Aphena'sBaptism">baptized our first Godchild</a>, Athena Lillian Samson! What an angel! She was tender the ENTIRE TIME! We just wanted to eat her up! I even had the privilege, for the first time ever, of having a bapy fall asleep in my arms. I've never felt so needed by something so young and innocent!

<b>Computer Stuff:</b>
Should be getting my replacement GF4 Ti 4600 card pretty soon. Getting pretty sick of analog VGA output, and could use my DVI... what a difference!
Instead of sending back my LOUD Western Digital 80GB Special Edition drive, I have decided that it's the perfect size for a backup/archival drive. I'm going to pick up an external USB 2.0/Firewire drive enclosure for it today. What I can do with this enclosure is grab the pertinent data off of the 25GB drive I'm selling in Michelle's old system Friday and then convert it to our permanent backup drive after that. I should be getting my Seagate Barracuda V 120GB drive on Wednesday, the same day I get Demo's system so he can have his very own Shuttle box!

<b>Pistons:</b>
Yipee!!!! They won round one of the playoffs. They start round 2 tomorrow against the Philadelphia 76ers at the Palace. Let's hope <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3094"><b>The Answer </b></a>doesn't school us up and down the court like <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3179"><b>T-Mac</b></a> did the first few games of round one! <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/profile?statsId=3174"><b>Chauncey Billups</b></a> was fantastic in round one!
