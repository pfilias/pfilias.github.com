So, I've had Comcast's DVR since Friday. I haven't used it all that much yet, as it's usually from the Fall through May that I do a lot of TV watching. Well, I watch HBO Soap Operas, but I am usually home on a Sunday night. It'll probably get more use to tape a lot of network shows this next season. It's sweet though, as it records High Definition. Tivo only offers that through one of the High Definition boxes that Direct TV uses. It's not as pretty as Tivo, but it works. And the tech that installed it told me that next month, they'll have a two tuner version, so you can tape on one and watch on the other!
