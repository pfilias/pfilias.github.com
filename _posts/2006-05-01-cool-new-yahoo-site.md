For those that are trying to manage ALL of the new technology that we're bombarded with and you DON'T want to call Peter and ask him; I suggest this site:

<a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo! Tech">http://tech.yahoo.com/</a>

This seems like a C|Net clone, but it falls under the Yahoo! brand name, which is about as easy to trust for most people as AOL is. (Real techies don't really trust AOL, but most non-geeks do!)
