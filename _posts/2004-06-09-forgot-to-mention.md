...<B>DEVASTATIA</B> about the Pistons losing last night. With less than a minute to go, they were up by 6 points. Then, they laid down. A 3 point play by Shaq, a missed jumper by Billups, and then that crazy, 2.4 (but the clock stopped at 2.1) seconds-left-in-regulation 3-pointer by Kobe... and he frickin' made it!!! After that, the Pistons laid down, for good. They lost, 99-91. Game 3 is tomorrow night, in "Michigan" as Al Michaels says it. I think people are generally afraid of Detroit.
