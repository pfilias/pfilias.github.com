I saw a bumper sticker while driving home on Eight Mile yesterday. It said:

When God Show Up
God Show Out

What does that mean? I did some research.



<blockquote>verb <strong>ushered, ushering</strong>

      1. To conduct or escort them, eg into or out of a building, room, etc.
            Thesaurus: show in, <strong><em>show out</em></strong>, lead, escort, receive.
            Form: usher someone in (usually)
            Form: usher someone out2. formal or literary
            To be a portent of it; to herald it.
            Example: technology that will usher in a new age of communication
            Thesaurus: introduce, launch, precede, initiate, herald, ring in.
            Form: usher something in</blockquote>

I'm cool with the whole religious thing, I'm religious myself. I'm not cool with the improper use of the English language. I'm quite appalled by it. Shouldn't it at least be: "When God Shows Up, God Shows Out"? Shows is the <strong>proper </strong>conjugation of the verb show.
