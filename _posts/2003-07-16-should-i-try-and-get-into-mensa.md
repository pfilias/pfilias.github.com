<b>Mensa:</b>
A friend of mine at work keeps urging me to give the MENSA exam a try. Not even for the silly meetings these geeks have, but for the magazine and the interesting topics that are discussed in the magazine.

<b>Today:</b>
Is the work day almost done yet? The guy buying my car has been approved for his loan! I can't wait to seal the deal! Saab 93 Vector, here I come!

<b>PayGrip:</b>
I <b>LOVE</b> PayGrip (aka <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>)!!
