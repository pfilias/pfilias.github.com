As I am slowly looking at playing World of Warcraft in my extreme "spare time", I've been poking around the net at my old "stomping grounds". I ran into this, where they talk about a new feature in World of Warcraft called the Dressing Room, where you can see how your character would look with items you're interested in buying.
