It's been a while since I shared some photos, and, surprisingly, I haven't taken that many photos in the past few weeks. I wonder why? Maybe I am in a "lull" for photo-taking.

Clicking that picture of Benjamin, walking at the park near our house, will take you to the latest gallery I've thrown up.

Here is one of Louie, Ben's cousin, after getting a little bit too frisky with the cooler!
