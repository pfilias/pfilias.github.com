Here's an example of what you'll find on that site:

Ape Drape (What else can you call it?)

By definition, this is already a painfully bad haircut, but on mullet standards it is in a state of infancy. All hair is combed back into a drape much like that of a gorilla or a chimp- hence the name 'ape drape'. Hair like this is unstylish to put it VERY gently, but it still shows a 'self contained' business man look. A mullet like this still allows the subject to ascend the corporate ladder. However, if this is allowed to go any further, it will lead to an immediate descent to very bottom with all the rest of the gutter trash.
