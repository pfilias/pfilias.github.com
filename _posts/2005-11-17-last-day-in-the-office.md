Well, today is my last day in the office. I work from home tomorrow. What a nice boss (Thanks, Jeff)!

I can't believe I've worked at <a href="http://www.ford.com">Ford Motor Company</a> for over 2 1/2 years! This is the longest I've ever held a job, post college. I'm looking forward to working at <a href="http://www.wayne.edu">Wayne State</a>. I've heard many good things about working there and have heard even better things about working in the academic environment. Hopefully, this environment will be a nice place for me to nurture and grow my skillz and to apply my MBA and IT knowledge.
