Thanks to Kevin for this one! He's always good for quality humor!

1. Two  times a week, we go to a nice restaurant, have a little beverage,
good food,  and companionship...
she goes on Tuesdays, I go on Fridays.

2. We also  sleep in separate beds...
hers is in California and mine is in  Texas.

3. I take my wife everywhere...
but she keeps finding her way  back.

4. I asked my wife where she wanted to go for our
anniversary.  "Somewhere I haven't been in a long time!" she said...
so I suggested the  kitchen.

5. We always hold hands...if I let go, she shops.

6. She  has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric
bread maker. She said  "There are too many gadgets and no place to sit
down!"... So I bought her an  electric chair.

7. My wife told me the car wasn't running well  because
there was water in the carburetor. I asked where the car was; she  told me
"In the lake."

8. She got a mud pack and looked great for two  days.
Then the mud fell off.

9. She ran after the garbage truck,  yelling "Am I too late
for the garbage?"... The driver said "No, jump  in!"

10. Remember: Marriage is the number one cause of  divorce.

11. I married Miss Right...I just didn't know her
first name  was Always.

12. I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months...
I don't  like to interrupt her.

13. The last fight was my fault though. My wife  asked "What's on the TV?"
...I said  "Dust!"
