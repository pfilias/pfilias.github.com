Last Friday, I had the day off and Michelle doesn't work on Fridays. She took Ben and I on a mystery trip to the Cranbrook Institute of Science.

It was more fun than I ever expected it to be with Ben. He was in heaven, having the entire place to himself, just about. It was the perfect time (mid-morning) to go there, before anyone goes there after school or work!

Here are some fun photos of our fun (click the first image to take you to the gallery):

Enjoying the exhibits, all to himself!

Ben sure is small compared to the Mastadon.
