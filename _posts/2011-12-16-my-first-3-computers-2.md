I was looking around the 'net today and found this cool site: <a href="http://www.oldcomputers.net">www.oldcomputers.net</a>.

<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html">Vic-20</a>

I had this computer in the 3rd grade, for about a month. We got sick of it quickly and got a Commodore 64 instead.<a href="http://peterfilias.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/vic20.jpg">

<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/c64.html">Commodore 64</a>

This computer was the base of my entire existence, damn-near, from 1983 - 1986 or 1987, when I got the Amiga 500. I got the Amiga in 7th grade or 8th grade. I know it was at least 7th grade, as it came out in 1987, which ended 7th grade for me. I remember selling people in Jr. High Commodore 64 games, so I must have still had the C64 at least in 7th grade. Anyway, I had my own phone line when I was 9 or 10 years old and ran the Snakepit/Snakepyt BBS and went by the handle Diamond Back. I had the grandest time during this pioneering era of home computing. I repeat, GRAND and PIONEERING at the same time.<a href="http://peterfilias.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/C64-left.jpg">

<a href="http://oldcomputers.net/amiga500.html">Commodore Amiga 500</a>

Can we say "game changer" here? Amazing computer. Amazing possibilities. True multitasking operating system. Separate chips for Audio, Video, and I think memory controlling. Even swapped out the Motorola 68000 for a 68010 for a slight bump in performance. I remember buying the <a href="http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=534">Commodore A590</a> hard drive for this thing. About $1000 and came with a 52MB Quantum SCSI hard drive. I can't believe I spent this kind of money. I also spent about $500 on a US Robotics Couriest HST modem that got around 14000 baud when connected to another Courier HST modem. Man, those were the days. I could go on and on about this. The people I hung out with. The activities I thought about doing, day in, and day out.<a href="http://peterfilias.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/amiga500.jpg">
