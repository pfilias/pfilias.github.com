I am SO excited that tonight's game on ABC is in High Definition!!! It LOOKS SO AMAZING! I can't wait until everything on television is in HDTV!!!! Stressed out? Why would you say that? Because I'm in FIVE Fantasy Football Leagues!!! Am I feeling like an asshole for NOT playing L. Coles of WAS, kind of!!! Am I an asshole because Curtis Martin hasn't done DICK yet, probably! Is Patrick Ramsey playing like a stud tonight? YES! OH WELL!!!
