<p>So, my transition from <a href="http://comcast.com/Corporate/Learn/DigitalVoice/digitalvoice.html">Comcast Digital Voice</a> to <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> is complete.

Here are the steps I took (mostly in this order):

1) Signed up for a <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> account, got a number to use in the 586 area code.
2) Bought an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI">ObiTalk 110</a> from <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> for $50.
3) Bought an <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/#fbid=0bl5abGXgz1">AT&amp;T</a> GoPhone from <a href="http://bestbuy.com">Best Buy</a> last week for $5, on sale from $10.
4) Bought a $15 card from <a href="http://www.7-eleven.com/">7-Eleven</a> as the phone needs to have minutes on it to be able to be truly active and forward calls temporarily to my <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> Account.
5) Configured <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI">ObiTalk 110</a> to connect to my <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> account.
6) Unplugged phones from <a href="http://comcast.com">Comcast</a> modem and plugged them into <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI">ObiTalk 110</a>.
7) Initiated a number porting of my home number to <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/#fbid=0bl5abGXgz1">AT&amp;T</a> (on the Go Phone).
8) A few days later, the port was complete and my Go Phone had my home phone number.
9) I enabled call forwarding on the Go Phone to ring my <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> number (which is tied into my home phones).
10) I initiated a number porting from <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/#fbid=0bl5abGXgz1">AT&amp;T</a> &gt; <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a>. Google only ports from mobile numbers.
11) 24 hours later, <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> has my home phone number.
12) I called <a href="http://comcast.com">Comcast</a> to verify my phone service was canceled, and it was, automagically via the number porting that occurred with <a href="http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/#fbid=0bl5abGXgz1">AT&amp;T</a>.
13) Asked <a href="http://comcast.com">Comcast</a> to give me a good rate on Double Play (from Triple Play). My new rate is $35/mo. less.
14) Investment: ObiTalk 110, $50. Go Phone: $5. Minutes: $15. Number porting: $20. TOTAL: $90. 12 month savings is $420. Not a bad deal here, and, I have a "burn" phone I can use once I get it a new number. ;)

In my research, I found this great review over at <a href="http://michigantelephoneblog.com">michigantelephoneblog.com</a>: <a href="http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/review-of-the-obihai-obi110-voip-device-part-1-use-your-phone-with-google-voice-for-free-incoming-and-outgoing-calls/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/review-of-the-obihai-obi110-voip-device-part-2-the-obitalk-portal-documentation-and-using-the-device-as-an-fxo-port-with-asterisk/">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/review-of-the-obihai-obi110-voip-device-part-3-911-on-the-cheap/">Part 3</a>, <a href="http://michigantelephone.wordpress.com/2011/01/30/review-of-the-obihai-obi110-voip-device-part-4-how-to-use-the-obi110-as-an-fxo-port-with-asterisk-and-freepbx/">Part 4</a>. Part 3 covers how to get 911 service, which you don't get with <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a>. That'll be my next step in this process, more like an addendum.
