It was a damn good time. I forgot to bring my camera which sucks because there are no photos, but is also cool because I didn't have to worry about taking a bunch of pictures like I normally do.

Anyway, we got a bunch of snow that day, making the commute to Camp Ticonderoga a mess. I decided to go right there from the salon instead of trying to make it home and back. I got there at about 6:20pm and hung out with our waitress for the night and drank two or three cups of coffee. I had a headache and needed the caffeine and the pick-me-up. Anyway, the night was hit! A handful of people didn't make it due to either the weather or not finding babysitters, including my mom. She was sad. I told her not to worry about it. I got to hang out with my mom and dad on Saturday... so all was well there. Besides...stinky bars aren't good for my mom and dad. I want to protect them from that stuff!
