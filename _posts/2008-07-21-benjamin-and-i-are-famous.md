I've been meaning to post this on my blog, but had forgotten to do so as I emailed it out to a handful of friends.

Here is the story:

&nbsp;
<blockquote>Someone who works at a University in Eastern Washington was reading the CNN/Money article about the top 100 places to live in 2008.</blockquote>
He went here: http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2008/snapshots/PL2672818.html and saw my picture and remembered meeting me and remembered that I worked at WSU. He sent an email to the general financial aid e-mail address asking if anyone knew who the man in the picture was.
