I have been seeing this Technorati stuff all over the web lately. First, I noticed it on <a href="http://snowsuit.net">The Snowsuit Effort</a> the other day, then I noticed it on some WordPress plugin sites. I then noticed it on some other sites over the last day or so... it's like in the last 4 days, I've seen this Technorati thing and then see it every single day now.
