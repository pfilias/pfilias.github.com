This game rocks.

Even <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/review.html?q=1&tag=gs_hp_flashtop_story">Gamespot</a> says so: <b>"<i>Such high quality simply cannot be expected, nor should it be missed.</i>"</b>

I am addicted to this game. I could be addicted to much worse things, right? This keeps me home, saves me money, so to speak.
