Well, Benjamin Peter came home yesterday, and the ride was unenventful. We decided to take Ben by St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church to show him where his mom and dad got married. Not sure he really absorbed much of it, but it was worth it, anyway. Regardless, he loved the ride home and didn't make a peep. We also drove by and showed him where we STARTED to think about him!
