Okay, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=technologyNews&storyID=6265028&src=rss/technologyNews&section=news">smaller version of the PS2 is coming out</a>. I wonder if this version is better, not just smaller? Does it come with the network adapter built-in? How about a hard drive built in? Wouldn't that be nice? Heck, I pulled mine out of retirement and I've fallen back in love with it!
