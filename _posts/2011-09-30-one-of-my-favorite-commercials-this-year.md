I'm a computer guy. I love computers and what we can do with them. I love the internet and what we can do with it. What I love <strong>MORE</strong> is what computers <strong>AND</strong> the internet allows us to do...and share...and dream...and share...and plot...and share. You get the idea.

This <strong><a title="Google Chrome" href="http://google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></strong> commercial is a great example of this idea.
