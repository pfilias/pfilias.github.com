I got my iPod case yesterday. I love it. It's going to be perfect for keeping my iPod safe while I work out and while I do things like running, biking, and snowboarding!

The name of the case is the Contour Showcase. Contour wants $39.95 for these. I got them at <a href="http://www.thenerds.net">http://www.thenerds.net</a> for $28.04 plus $9.95 ($38.03) for shipping. Great deal.
