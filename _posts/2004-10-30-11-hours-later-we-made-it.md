Talk about shitty weather!!! It rained almost the ENTIRE WAY... We had an uneventful, trip, though, which is good. Had to add a little air to the front driver's side tire. :D

I can't wait to see this place in the daylight!!!

Oh yeah, thanks to Bill at work, we listened to The Da Vinci Code the entire way here. We aren't even halfway done with it yet, but now I know why the book was selling like hotcakes!!! We can't wait to hear more of it on the way home, Tuesday!
