On the left is my Aunt Kiki. She just passed away about one hour ago. Her husband, John, passed away this winter. And in September of 2003, their oldest daughter, Georgia, passed away from an annheurism. In less than two years, my cousin, Lola, has lost her whole family. Now, the only Filiases left are us and my dad's cousin Nick and his two sons, one of which has girls.
