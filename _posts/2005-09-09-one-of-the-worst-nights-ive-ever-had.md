So, last night, about 11pm, I take my medication for acne, <a href="http://www.dynacin.com/PRESCRIBING/main.html">Dynacin</a>. Right on the bottle, it has a sticker that says to be sure to take it with plenty of water. I normally do. That's where my problem started. I did my usual of sticking my head under the sink with the capsule in my mouth. It kind of went down, but I didn't drink more water. Thought it'd be no biggie. Well, as I'm about to brush my teeth, a few minutes later, I have a quick burp. Immediately following this burp, I feel a burning sensation in my nose and my eyes start watering like I've just seen my whole family get slaughtered by a gang of looters and rapists. I tell Michelle I just burped up my medicine and she starts laughing. I was like, "What are you laughing at?" When she came into the bathroom, she realized I was in distress (nasal). For the next 9 hours, my nose and eyes are in utter grief. I was blowing my nose and spitting up the yellow powder that lives inside one of these Dynacin capsules ALL NIGHT LONG! My head felt like a pumpkin grew inside of it. OUCH. OUCH. OUCH. I managed to fall asleep at around 1:30AM and woke up at around 4:00AM. Benjamin woke up at about 4:30AM. He normally wakes up at 6:00-7:30AM, so this was not a good night. At 4:00AM, I took Sudafed. Didn't do shit for the congestion. Took my Allegra-D at about 6:00AM so that my allergies wouldn't get me ON TOP of the medicine "snort" that I accidentelly did at 11PM.

Well, nothing worked for my congestion until I bought some nasal spray that contains 1% Phenylephrine HCl. Worked in about 2 minutes. Supposed to take it every 4 hours. After 2 hours, I'm starting to feel it wear off. My poor mucous membranes must hate me.

Anyway, NEVER snort Dynacin if you ever thought it'd be fun. I didn't even MEAN to snort it. For now on, when I take it, I'm going to drink 32 oz. of water!
