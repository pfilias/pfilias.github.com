Tonight, I'm taking my wife out for a very nice dinner, pre-Valentine's day style. We have other commitments tomorrow, and I think it'll be a little less hectic tonight. I'm quite excited about it, actually. Not excited about dropping the coin, but what's a guy to do?

I'm also thrilled to see if my mom, mother-in-law, and wife, like the flowers they are going to receive today. (The chance my wife is reading this...0.000001%). It's kind of like a little game I'm playing with myself. (I'm bored).

Oh yeah, I got her an awesome gift for V-Day, even though we said we aren't doing this. I think it's a necessity for her... she'll love it.
