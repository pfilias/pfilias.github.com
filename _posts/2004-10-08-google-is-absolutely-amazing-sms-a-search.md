I can't believe this. I'm going to try it right now.

<b>How do I use it?

   1. Enter your query as a text message. See some sample queries.

   2. Send the message to the US shortcode 46645 (GOOGL on most phones).

   3. Receive a text message (or messages) with your results, usually within a minute. Results may be labeled as "1of3", "2of3", etc.

   4. To get Google SMS help info sent directly to your phone, send the word 'help' as a text message to 46645.
