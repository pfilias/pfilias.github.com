We had a very enjoyable Father's Day with our two families yesterdy. First, we had a brunch at Cherry Creek Golf Club in Shelby Township.

Michelle's whole family was there: Diana, Thomas, Kimberly, Matthew, and Louis. We had a very enjoyable time, exchanged stories, and had some very good food.

Before I left Cherry Creek, I wanted to offer Ben up to the Gods.

Later in the day, we went to my mom and dad's house for a barbeque with my entire family, sans Kyle (Gina's boyfriend). Lela, Athanasios, Dino, Danielle, Gina, Michelle, myself, and Benjamin!
