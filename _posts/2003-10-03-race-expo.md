We went to the Whole Foods health expo this evening to pick up our race packets that had our bib numbver, our champion chip, and other running shwag. We're excited. We also signed up for the pace team we're going to run with. I am really hoping the pace team will help pull us through the race. I think it's going to work out well!!

But geez, the expo in Chicago was gigantic!! It was like a mini Auto Show compared to the expo tonight. That's okay though. We still loved it!
