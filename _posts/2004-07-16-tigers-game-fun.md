Yesterday, we went to Comerica Park to watch the Tigers play the Yankees...and lose. Oh well. Can't win 'em all.

Anyway, I thought I noticed her outside, but was puzzled as to why she'd be going to a Tigers game. Then, when I saw her and her 3 friends walk into Copa, through the regular gates, I knew it was her. <strong><a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0004695/">Jessica Alba</a></strong> currently dating Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees.

Anyway, I thought it was cool. I felt bad about being the creepy photo guy, but I felt good about it, too.
