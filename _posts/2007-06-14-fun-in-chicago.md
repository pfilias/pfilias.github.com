Look at how much fun Benjamin and Ellie were having in the hotel!

We had a wonderful trip this past weekend, meeting up with Dave, Sarah, and Ellie, to spend a day at the Brookfield Zoo and spend some time in the hotel while the kids played and also along the Lake Michigan seashore in downtown Chicago. There, we were able to meet up with Mark and his nearly 3 year old daughter, Reese. What a cutie!!!
