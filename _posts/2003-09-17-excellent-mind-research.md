A friend of mine gave me this today:

<em>&#8220;Aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabridge Uinervtisy, it deosn&rsquo;t mttaer in what order the ltteers in a word are, the only iprmoetnt thing is that the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae.  The rset can be a ttaol mses and you can still raed it wouthit porbelm.  This is bcuseae the human mind deos not raed ervey lteter by istleft, but the word as a wlohe.  Fcuknig amzanig, huh?&#8221;</em>
