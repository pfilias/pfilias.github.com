I'm officially back to work, in the Dearborn office. Days are a bit longer and more tiring so far. Yesterday and tomorrow, especially, as I still have a few more class sessions. June 27 is my last day of class. After that, my work week will get back to normal and I should have more time to get to work early so I can get out to the park with Michelle and Ben!
