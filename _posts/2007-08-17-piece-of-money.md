"You have a piece of money by your foot daddy!"
-- Benjamin Filias, after seeing a quarter fall out of my pants pocket this morning.

<strong>I absolutely love and cherish the little things that Benjamin says. </strong>

Other things he's said that I think are awesome:

"It dos" -- instead of "it does".
"Papa Tone" -- instead of "Tone", my brother's cat who lives at my parents' house.
"Be careful daddy!" -- when he sees me using things like knives and scissors, because Michelle told him those things are dangerous.
