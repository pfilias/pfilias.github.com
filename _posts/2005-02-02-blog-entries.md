I just haven't been blogging that much lately. At least I feel this way. I'm not sure why. I feel like I have a hectic winter. I have two classes, one on Wednesday nights and one on Saturday mornings. The Wednesday night class will shift over to an online course for about 6 weeks or so. That'll make my weenights free and clear since I've switched to going to the gym in the morning.

I want a Treo 650. I have problems. I wish they were cheap. They aren't. They are like $420, via Sprint's site. Maybe I can try and find someone that would be able to get me one for a "deal". I'd want to sell my phone and my Axim X3i if I were going to make a switch like this, naturally.

UPDATE: That price is if you sign up for a new account. I hate that.
