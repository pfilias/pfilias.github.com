I've been so busy at work with some new responsibilities that I haven't had a chance to blog much lately.

Michelle and I had a good time camping with her sister and husband last weekend, as well as with her 3 younger cousins. It was the first time we'd ever camped with her cousins. I enjoyed myself, as did Michelle!

I have a final that is due tomorrow night at midnight. I can't wait until that is done. Then, it's about 11 weeks of rest before the Fall semester starts up!
