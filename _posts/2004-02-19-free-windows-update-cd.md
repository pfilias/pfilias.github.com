Sick of downloading Windows Updates? Or don't feel like doing it?

<b>NOTE:</b> These updates only go through October 2003. So if you're on a high-speed connection, this CD won't do much for you. It's kind of for those cats that don't have internet or on dial-up. And if they have NO internet, then it's kind of pointless, since there is no way their PC can be "infiltrated".
