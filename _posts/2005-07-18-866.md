At 7 1/2 weeks old, Benjamin Peter Filias got baptized yesterday. Despite the hot and steamy weather, the baptism and luncheon afterwards were wonderful! Dave and Sarah came into town from Green Bay to share and celebrate Ben's big day. It was very nice to have guests stay with us over the weekend. We capitalized on the muggy weather by shopping and eating all day and night on Saturday. We had a great time!
