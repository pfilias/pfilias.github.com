I can't believe this shit. What's it gonna take to just get rid of these bastards over there? I guess I'd be kind of pissed if there was a foreign military group here in the U.S. I'd want to get rid of them, too. It's almost like an ongoing movie.

<b>Running last night:</b>
Michelle and I had an amazing 7 miler last night. Just about the exact same time as last weeks, but this time, we kept it VERY consistent! We used the Timex GPS watch to <b>TRY</b> and keep us between an 8:50 and 9:15 pace. The longest stretch we had where we were actually IN that pace was about 10-15 seconds! I have to hand it to the pros, they are amazing. I guess they can run an entire marathon and only vary their mile pace by 2 seconds! AMAZING! Simply amazing! I kicked it up a notch the last mile, and did it in 7:38. I was hoping I'd do it faster. I think I did the first 1/2 mile faster, but started to lose a little bit of steam near the end. All in all, a great run. This morning's run was very difficult. It took nearly 40 minutes. I didn't have the energy and lungs (it seemed) to run any faster. After all, I had just run 7 miles less than 12 hours ago!
