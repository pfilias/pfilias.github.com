My fake cousin, Ike, sent me this:

An Arab needed a heart transplant, but prior to the surgery the doctors
needed to store his blood in case
the need arises.  Because the gentleman had a rare type of blood, it
couldn't be found locally. So the call went out to a
number of countries. Finally, a Jew was located who had similar type of
blood. The Jew willingly donated
his blood for the Arab. After the surgery, the Arab sent the Jew as
appreciation for giving his blood, a new
Rolls, diamonds, lapis lazuli jewelry, and a million US dollars.
Unfortunately, the Arab had to go through a corrective
surgery once again.  His doctor telephoned the Jew who was more than happy
to donate his blood again. After the second
surgery, the Arab sent the Jew a thank you card and a jar of Almond Roca
sweets.
The Jew was shocked to see that the Arab this time did not reciprocate the
Jew's kind gesture as he had anticipated. He phoned
the Arab and asked him why he had expressed his appreciation in not so
generous manner. The Arab replied
"Habibi, now I have Jewish blood."
