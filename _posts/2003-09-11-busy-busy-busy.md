It's been pretty busy for me at work lately. Spending some time now preparing for my review meeting on Monday. It's when I get the nod or not for being extended an offer for permanent Ford employment! Wish me luck!

<b>Big week of running</b>
Tonight we do 5 miles, to end the mid week long running of our training. We will have run 20 miles in the past 3 days, and 40 in 5 days after Saturday morning!

<b>Microwave saga</b>
Not sure why, but every direction I turn towards getting our Microwave (had it since the end of June) installed, I run into a brick wall. I don't get it. The fourth guy is going to come by at 2pm on Saturday to give us his rundown. Let's see what he can come up with.
