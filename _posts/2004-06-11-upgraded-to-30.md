I have upgraded the Movable Type engine from version <strong>2.64</strong> to <strong>3.0D</strong>. I'm pretty excited about it. However, in doing so, I had to disable the breadcrumb navigation from within this system. When someone from their support forum writes me back, I'll try and get that navigation element (breadcrumbs) back in.

I do see that they added the formatting buttons in browsers other than Internet Explorer (I use Mozilla's <strong>Firefox</strong>).
