It's been a while since I blogged about something that caught my eye. I was looking at an issue of Wired Magazine that highlights the "best" gear of certain categories. It's kind of like a Consumer Reports issue for people who actually buy cool stuff, and not can openers.

Anyway, Oregon Scientific, normally known for making wireless weather stations, alarm clocks, and other "gadgets" you'd typically see at Sharper Image, has come up with a pretty cool audio solution for using your iPod at home.
