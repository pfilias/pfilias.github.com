This weekend was great. The weather was awesome through and through. Had a nice motorcycle ride yesterday morning, enjoyed watching football (even thought the Lions are disappointing) with Michelle, and really enjoyed running to Michelle's mom and dad's house where we had a mini-birthday celebration! Good thing they were home, as we needed the ride back!
