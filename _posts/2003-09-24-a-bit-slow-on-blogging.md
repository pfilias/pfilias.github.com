Maybe I've just been "booked" the past few days. I haven't had much energy to write anything. The fire will be fueled soon. I've been fighting with getting a job offer at work, to go direct, and with making sure AximUsers.com is what it was meant to be: A KICK ASS SITE for the Dell Axim of now and of the future!

<b>RUNNING IS ALMOST OVER!</b>
We only have a few more runs to go. I could use a break for a few weeks, but this time, I don't want to quit like I did last year. This year, I've got everything in the world going for me. I have a job, as a soon-to-be direct employee of Ford Motor Company, I am in school, I have a house, a new car, and great health for me and my family. Last year, I was laid off, lived in an apartment, had no prospects for jobs because the market seems to slow down a bit during the upcoming holidays, and my cholesterol was high.
