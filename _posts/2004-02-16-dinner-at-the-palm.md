Believe me... the Palm isn't going to happen THAT often... they had this deal for dinner for $130. Big steak, 3lb. Lobster, bunch o' stuff, 2 splits of champagne. We thought, no way. So we ordered up... bill came to $156 w/o tip.

We had four $10.75 Ketel One, Starbucks Espresso, Kahlua, Chocolate Liquer martinis, thankyouverymuch. $43.00 in drinks. DAMN.

Dr. Richard Golden (D.O.C.) sat behind us!
