Oh boy!!! Finally! I got a job!!! Yippee!!! Six long months, and yes, they were very long. They were a little bit fun at first; I could stay up late at night, playing computer games, doing my "computer lifing" and all, sleeping in, etc. However, what I didn't do during those first few months was hit the gym and hit it hard. I was lazy, partially depressed, if you will. I won't, I never get depressed, but a man's spirits get a little bit low when you find yourself in that predicament.

Now, however, things have changed. <b><i>I've started working out, religiously, four weeks ago, so things are going well in the exercise and muscle-building area</i></b>, and also, I found a job, with a very large company. I'll be working for Ford as a contractor for six months, and then I'll be brought in, <b>direct</b>, as a <b><a href="http://www.ford.com"><font color="#0000FF">Ford</font></a></b> employee. This is all part of their PreView program, designed to bring people into Ford, and possibly into their IT arena. I believe their new CIO wants to "bring in" a lot of the IT work that was once outsourced as a push to strengthen their core comptencies! Let it happen. Here I am, over here...here...here!!!

So, I go into this weekend happy as hell. My wife, Michelle, is <b>THRILLED </b>to death that she's not the sole breadwinner anymore. We can continue looking for a house again, and resume where we left off on September 20, 2002. I am HOPING I start work on March 24 so I can have some free time to finally ENJOY my time off and go visit my friends out in Phoenix, maybe even get some sun!

Have a good weekend!
