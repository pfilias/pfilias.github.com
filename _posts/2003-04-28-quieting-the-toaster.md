I guess I got it a little quieter...the SN41G2, that is. Further research leads me to believe that my "high speed" Western Digital hard drive whines!

So...if NewEgg lets me, I'm going to send back the WD and get a Seagate Barracuda V, which is much quieter!

Trying to sell my V-Dub. Thought a guy from Cheboygan would buy it, but he's not interested. Oh well, let's see what EBay yields me... auction ends tomorrow at 10AM.

I wanted to take advantage of GM's 0% APR through April 30. Probably won't happen.

Great weather. Ran 4 yesterday. Wanted to ride today...but my back tire needs a new tube.
