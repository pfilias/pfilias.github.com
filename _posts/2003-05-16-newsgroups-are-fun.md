Everything is just hunky-dory over here. Computer is just hummin' away. Newsgroups are spittin' out the files faster than I can burn the CDs. I love it. Absolutely love it. I love that I'm going to "bless" my friends with good games right now. Absolutely love nothing more than that!

We're off to April's 30th birthday party! We're getting there! Let's just hope we're only 1/3 done. <b>April, Happy Birthday (early)!!!</b>
