Michelle and I are leaving for Green Bay tonight some time after 8pm from Flint! We're pretty excited to go visit Pepe, Sarah, and his family. We're invited to his engagement party which is being held on Saturday at the Pappas family house. We also get to see the house that Pepe and Sarah bought, as well as getting to go to Monday Night Football at Lambeau Field with the Packers vs. the Eagles! My 2nd Monday Night game and my 3rd game at Lambeau overall. My other game was actually a Sunday night game. I've never been there during the game.
