One of my favorite authors <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwqg5YsJqDBamy8X_c4f2AdN1FkgD94904FG0">passed away</a> the other day of cancer. I saw this on a coworker's monitor yesterday up at TMZ but was hoping it was false. I heard on Fox News this morning the news, and felt sad that I won't get to read any more books by Crichton. :(
