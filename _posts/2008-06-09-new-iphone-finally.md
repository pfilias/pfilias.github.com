<a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/">MacRumors.com : Worldwide Developer Conference 2008 Keynote Live Coverage</a><br /><br />Finally, a "real" iPhone just got announced. The iPhone 3G.

It's thinner, has a black plastic back (no more shiny metal), and is 2.8x faster than its earlier phone for data, with data speeds nearing WiFi speeds.<br /><blockquote></blockquote>
