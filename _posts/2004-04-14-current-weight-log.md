Okay, so I've had a bad Winter. I didn't think it'd be so bad, but this is looking to be our most active Spring/Summer YET in terms of training. I can't wait. I am gearing my body up for 27 weeks of 6-days-a-week training starting on May 3 and ending on October 31. We're hoping to get into the Marine Corps Marathon (lottery)  in Washington D.C. If we don't get in, we'll do another race that day, maybe the Cape Cod Marathon!
