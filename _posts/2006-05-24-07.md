Benjamin, your mother and I would like to wish you a <strong>happy birthday</strong>. You've filled out lives with <strong>joy</strong>, <strong>love</strong>, <strong>tenderness</strong>, and laughter this first year. You've taught us that there is nothing more important than you. People can wait. Activities can wait. You are the most amazing little boy in the whole world and I can't wait to come home from work each and every night!
