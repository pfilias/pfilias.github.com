In two days, Michelle and I are going to Mackinac Island for the weekend. I'm so excited!! We're staying at a bed and breakfast called Bay View. I will be working a half-day on Friday... can't wait!

<b>Gods and Generals:</b>
We finished watching Gods and Generals last night. Man, what a long movie. Wasn't that awesome if you ask me. Maybe they just needed a more modern Civil War movie? Seemed like it. I love Robert Duvall, but I feel that he's done much better in other films. 6.5/10 for me.
