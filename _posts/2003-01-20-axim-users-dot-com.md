Hey friends. I've been pretty busy getting Axim Users Dot Com up and running. It's evolved from a forum using Invision Board to a portal based on the Invision Board. It's getting rave reviews so far, and a small community is forming.

I've had a headache with my Axim X5 and Dell's customer service and tech support thus far. My directional pad sucks, as do many others with the Axim so far.

I'm still unemployed. Going on four months now. It's getting kind of old. I HAVE been busy with side work lately, so that's a good thing.
