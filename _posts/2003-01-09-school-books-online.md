Hey friends! It's been a few days since I've blogged. I'm about to head down to school for my first class in my pursuit for an MBA!

I found the book I need on <a href="http://www.half.com">www.half.com</a> for $30 plus shipping (used) compared to $97.35 for it new. Man, I love the internet as a community!

Let's hope Michelle enjoyed her first day at school. I have a feeling she's not going to like this class she's in. Finite Element Analysis. ICK!
