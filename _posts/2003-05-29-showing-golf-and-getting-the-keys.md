<b>Golf GTI:</b>
Showed a guy my car last night. He bent my fucking rim... it was already bent, but this bend that happened caused my tire to have a slow leak. Almost went flat this morning. Am I ever going to sell my fucking car?

<b>House:</b>
We get the keys in 30 minutes! We can't wait!!! It's gonna be an ultra fun and ultra busy weekend! We have a baseball game to go to, we have other stuff going on!! Yippee!

<b>Work:</b>
I have only been in my location (cube) at work for about 4 weeks or so. Boom, we are moving tomorrow. So every month, I get a new location. This new cube is smaller, and the cube walls are only half-height...which kind of sucks. What can you do? 2 months as a contractor down, 4 to go!

<B>GOODNIGHT!</B>
