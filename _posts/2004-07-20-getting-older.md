Sheesh, time files.

I can't believe this was five years ago. Even then, I wasn't a little "kid" anymore. And now, five years later, I don't "feel" any younger. Also, our friend, "Rambo", was alive back then. Sinan lived around here and we hung out quite a bit. Sheesh. I wonder what other old photos I can look at that will make me sad.

The bright side of things is that I have a long life ahead of me with my best friend, Michelle. We have many things to see and do before we whither and die.
