I can't believe this poor guy from Brazil. He was winning the race with 3 miles to go and he gets attacked by some former priest from Ireland. What a mishap. I feel bad for this guy. Although he received a special award from the IOC, it still doesn't equate to a WIN in a marathon, and a Gold Medal in the Olympics!

<b>TRAGIC!</b>
