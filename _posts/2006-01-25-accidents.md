This is funny. Thanks, Pepe, for the good one!
<blockquote>The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged they had
covertly funded a multi-state project with auto makers where black box
voice recorders were installed in four-wheel drive pickup trucks and SUV's
in an effort to understand the last 15 seconds of a fatal accident. The
Board was surprised to find the recorded last words of drivers in 48 of the 50
states were all the same: "Oh, SHIT!" Only the states of Wisconsin and
Minnesota were different, where the final words wer  e: "Hold  my beer, I'm
gonna try somethin."</blockquote>
