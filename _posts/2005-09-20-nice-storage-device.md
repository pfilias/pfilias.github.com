I'm all about portable storage. Currently, I have a 20GB laptop hard drive in an enclosure that uses the USB bus for power. Small, simple, one cable. I love it. It's nice to have an enclosure you can throw into a bag, and this 8GB product from Lacie is even cooler, as you could literally throw it into a shirt or coat pocket.
