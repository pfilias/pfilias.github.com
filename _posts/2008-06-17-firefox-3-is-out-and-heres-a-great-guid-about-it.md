It seems that <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">lifehacker.com</a> puts out some great information. I ran across this on my <a href="http://igoogle.com">iGoogle.com</a> page a few minutes ago. I've been using Firefox 3 for quite some time now (as a supplement to my normal Firefox 2, Safari, and <a href="http://caminobrowser.org">Camino</a> browsing habits). As the releases neared release, they kept getting more stable. Now that I've had it installed for a few hours, I have to say I'm pretty happy about it.

I've also installed <a href="http://www.flock.com/beta/download">Flock 2 Beta 1</a>... a great browser based on Firefox 3 if you're heavily into social websites and sharing your media (like photos with Flickr, for instance).
