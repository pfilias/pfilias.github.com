The only thing I don't like about school is exams in classes that are a bit more complicated. My exam earlier this week in Information Systems was simple. I breezed through it. I love the material. I know the material. I live the material. On the other hand, Corporate Finance is a bit tougher. I've done all the homework, and Michelle's helped me grasp the concepts quite a bit. They are confusing though, but I'm gonna give it my best!
