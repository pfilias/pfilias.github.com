The current Jeopardy champion is awesome!!! My friend Scott told me about last night's show. His final wager was a computer geek's codeword for "elite". Besides that, there was a videogame category covering games like Unreal Tournament and Everquest!

Here's the info from a newsgroup posting:
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=jeopardy+1337&hl=en&lr=&selm=29ydnQYQKJfUJA_cRVn-vw%40giganews.com&rnum=1">Posting</a>

I'd like to find an article about it.
