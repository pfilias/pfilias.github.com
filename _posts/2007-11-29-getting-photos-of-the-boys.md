This evening, we're getting photos taken of Benjamin and Christopher. It'll be the first photos of Christopher we've had taken, and the 2nd photos of Benjamin we'll have taken with Kelly Scaccia, who did a very nice job with Ben's 2 year photos. We're excited to see how they turn out.Speaking of photos, I need to devote some more time to taking more professional (and retouched) photos of my family. I've got the equipment, the software...I just have to make more time for that.
