Thanks to Pepe for sending me this!
<blockquote>A United States marine was attending some college courses between
assignments. He had completed missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of
the  courses had a professor who was an avowed atheist and a member of
the ACLU.

One day the professor shocked the class when he came in. He looked to
the  ceiling and flatly stated, "God, if you are real, then I want you
to knock  me off this platform. I'll give you exactly 15 minutes." The
lecture room  fell silent. You could hear a pin drop. Ten minutes went
by and the  professor proclaimed, "Here I am God. I'm still waiting." It
got down to  the last couple of minutes when the marine got out of his
chair, went up  to the professor, and cold-cocked him knocking him off
the platform.

The professor was out cold. The marine went back to his seat and sat there,
silently. The other students were shocked and stunned and sat there
looking on in silence. The professor eventually came to, noticeably
shaken, looked at the marine and asked, "What the hell is the matter
with  you? Why did you do that?"

The marine calmly replied, "God was too busy today protecting America's troops who are protecting your right to say stupid shit and act like an asshole. ................ So, He sent me."</blockquote>
