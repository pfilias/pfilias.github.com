I had a great time going on my first sailing outing. Gord, from my old Ford days, asked me to come out this week. We had to postpone Monday due to monsoons! Yesterday turned out to be a gorgeous day. I had a half-day, and arrived in Tecumseh, ON, at a great time to hit the lake.<br />

A couple of Keith's along the way, and the pineapple/shrimp pizza was delicious!!!
