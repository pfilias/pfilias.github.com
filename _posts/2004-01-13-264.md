This came from my buddy, Kevin:

<blockquote>Can you imagine walking down the hallway at work to get a coffee and BAM
the glass shatters and this bad boy comes running down the hallway?  This
deer jumped through the office window at one of the offices down at Visteon
in Grandeview.  About 8:10 yesterday morning the deer ran straight through
the mirrored window and into the office.  Who needs to sit in a tree stand
all morning when they can come right to your office?  Since the office
window is mirrored on the outside, this buck must have been looking for a
fight.</blockquote>
