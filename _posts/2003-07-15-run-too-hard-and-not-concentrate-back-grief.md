<b>Running...ouch!</b>
I tried to run fast today, as I normally have been doing on the shorter, 3 mile runs... I was running a decent clip of 8.2 mph when I turned to my cousin, Ike, and felt my back tweak. OUCH and DAMNIT! I don't need this shit happening to me while I'm trying to improve my speed! It set me back for a few, but I continued forward at 8.2 mph for the rest of the run. Besides the hold-up, it was my fastest run yet.... speed-wise. However, my watch didn't reflect this due to my grief. :(
