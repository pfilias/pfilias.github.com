Thanks to Victor, at work, for sending me this link.

Looks like there is a "hacker-speak" tile set you can buy for your Scrabble game. This new set of tiles gives bonuses for using l33t tiles for substitutions of normal letters. For example, you can use the letter "4" as an "A", or a "3" for an "E".
