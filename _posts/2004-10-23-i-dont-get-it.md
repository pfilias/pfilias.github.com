I didn't blog a single thing since talking about going to the Lions games that they lost, dagnabbit!!!

What's new? Not much. Just have a darned migraine headache. I guess, while I'm up, I should get working on doing a dry run of a <a href="http://phpbb.com">phpBB </a>installation using Microsoft Access as the database and IIS as the webserver, rather than doing this on a Linux machine. Oh yeah, I also have to install PHP. Should be a good time. And the crazy thing about this? Julio found me on <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, searching for "phpbb consulting". We were on the fifth page.
