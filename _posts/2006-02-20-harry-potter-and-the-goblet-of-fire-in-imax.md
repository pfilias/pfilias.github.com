<p>Michelle and I went to the movies last night for the first time in a while. We decided that we'd get the most bang for our buck by seeing Harry Potter in the IMAX theater at the AMC near our house. Well, we were very impressed with both the presentation of the film and the film, itself! This, being the 4th Harry Potter movie, was "brilliant"! The entire movie had us excited and in awe. I just love the scenery in fantasy movies. It just seems that the creativity is left to the imagination in movies like that.</p>
<p>Rating: <strong>4.5/5</strong> stars.
