I can't believe this. I'm having an adult (at least I think it's an educated adult I'm talking to) conversation with my friend from high school. I'll leave his name out to save him embarrassment.

My friend:
<blockquote>I'll take it off your bill! Your in BYATCH!!!</blockquote>
Me:
<blockquote>And it's "you're" in.</blockquote>
My friend:
<blockquote>Nope, what country did you grow up in?</blockquote>
Me:
<blockquote>Are you retarded? When you say "your in", that means my "in" is ???

When I say "you're in", I am saying "you are in".

Where did you go to college? Oh right.... Geeeez.</blockquote>
My friend:
<blockquote>I believe you are the retarded one. You should learn to speak English like the rest of the country!</blockquote>
