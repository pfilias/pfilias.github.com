I was reading some advertising information for AnandTech...

<i>From April 1997 to the present day, AnandTech's front page has received millions of visitors. Monthly AnandTech receives over forty million pageviews.</i>

Wow. My site, Axim Users Dot Com (http://www.aximusers.com), receives about 150,000 pageviews per month, on a good month. Seems to be growing a slight bit... But that is .375% of what AnandTech receives!!! WOWZA! Based on some SUPER rough estimations of ad revenue, that site could make well over $100,000 per month in ad revenue! Crazy!
