WOW!!! Two new <ttag>videogame</ttag> machines are coming out in the next 10 months or so. In December, we have the <ttag>XBOX 360</ttag> from <ttag>Microsoft</ttag>. In Spring 2006, we have the <ttag>Playstation 3</ttag> from Sony coming out!

This thing sounds awesome. Dual <ttag>HDTV </ttag>outputs. Support for games up to <ttag>1080p</ttag>. <ttag>802.11b</ttag> for connectivity with Sony <ttag>PSP</ttag>s. <ttag>Bluetooth</ttag> for use with its controllers. The list goes on an on!
