I'm in the VERY warm Phoenix. It's gorgeous out here, and I didn't even get a chance to see it in the daytime yet (this time around). We met up with Sean last night for a few cocktails in southern Scottsdale, just north of Tempe. Man, it sure was nice (weather) last night. I think it's nice here every night. :D

Lots to explore today!
