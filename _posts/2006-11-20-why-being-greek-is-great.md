I got this from my cousin, Demo:

Why Being Greek is Great

- Because we have a small, poor country full of people with big hearts.
- Because we never visit others empty handed.
- Because there is no way to explain to foreigners what is "kapsoura" (burning desire for someone).
- Because in Greece family is still something valuable.
- Because we always make it, albeit in the last moment.
- Because we were slaves for 400 years yet never bring that up as an excuse for our current state.
- Because we are everywhere around the planet.
- Because "filotimo" (friend of honour, helping someone because it is a shame not to) does not exist in any other language.
- Because whenever foreigners cannot find a word, they use one of ours.
- Because we spend our bad and low times with our friends and family, not with shrinks.
- Because Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were Greek.
- Because we invented theatre.
- Because we gave birth to Democracy.
- Because we discovered logic.
- Because we jumpstarted science.
- Because we are proud of our culture, not of our wars.
- Because when we were building the Parthenon, the others were still sleeping on trees
- Because we gave the light to all these leaders who are "striving" for peace by making wars.
- Because we have a distinction between Eros (falling in love) and Agapi (innocent love), while we feel both of them passionately.
- Because Eros was a Greek God.
- Because we gave the oath "freedom or death".
- Because when others used to be clothed with wolf skin we were weaving see-through linen.
- Because "Greeks do not fight as heroes, heroes fight like Greeks" (Winston Churchill,1941).
- Because we are not ashamed to cry.
- Because we dance when we are sad.
- Because we work to live and do not live to work.
- Because 97% of the stars' names are Greek.
- Because when you shout "brother or cousin " in the streets everyone turns around.
- Because the inside of all our churches are not dark but full of light.
- Because our parents do not forget that we exist when we reach 18.
- Because when we want to sunbathe, we go to the beach, we don't crawl on grass or jump into fountains.
- Because our sun is healthy-you know this, bc grandma say it's good for your bones
- Because we confront every difficulty with humor.
- Because the Olympic games were born in Greece.
- Because, with OUR (Olympic) light, we unite the world and pass the message of peace.
- Because our sky is blue, not grey.
- Because 40% of Oxford dictionary is made up with Greek words.
- Because we know what "Kefi" (propensity to fun) means.
- When you people were eating leaves, we had cholesterol.
