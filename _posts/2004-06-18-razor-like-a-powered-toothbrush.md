Michelle picked up one of those Gillette powered razors for me. The ones that use a AA battery in the shaft. The razor is pretty much like any of my other Mach razors, but it vibrates like a powered toothbrush. The result: a closer shave, with less effort and less trauma to my skin!

Thanks, Michelle!
