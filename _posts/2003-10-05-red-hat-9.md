I was bored the other day, and I was thinking: Since I use Unix servers at work for web development now and going forward, and since my server runs on Red Hat 7, I think it'd be a great idea to run Red Hat Linux at home, somewhere. Well, for now, I installed it on my laptop (this, what I'm working on right now). I am dual-booting. And I have to say that I'm thrilled. Damn 1600x1200 screen on this thing is kind of tough and hard to read, but I'm managing at the moment.

I am VERY impressed with how sharp the screen fonts are. I think the fonts are as smooth as the fonts on Mac OS X are. Windows XP doesn't do very well with its Clear Type technology, but it IS a valiant effort.

That's all, just wanted to say how thrilled I am with Red Hat 9 on this laptop. I'll probably install it on my desktop, too.
