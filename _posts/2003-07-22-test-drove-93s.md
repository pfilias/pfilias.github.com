<b>93 Vector:</b>
Oh yeah, we drove two 93s yesterday. One was a Vector with an automatic transmission. Michelle loved it. She liked how you didn't have to worry about shifting. I liked it, but I LOVED how the Arc (same motor) with the 6-speed felt. It was <b>WAY</b> more responsive! I can't wait to get it!
