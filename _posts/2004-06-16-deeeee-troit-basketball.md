WOOOOO HOOOOO!!! They did it! They won the NBA Championship!!! They PUT IT to the Lakers...<b>BAD!!!</B>

The Detroit Pistons won the series, 4 games to 1! Good job this year, Dumars, Brown, Davidson, and the entire Pistons organization!

I enjoyed tonight's game with my loving wife, Michelle, and my brother, Dino, and future sister-in-law, Danielle. It was fun to have them over!
