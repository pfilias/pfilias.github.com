A colleague of mine had a <a href="http://doteduguru.com/id3038-are-you-human-is-captcha-needed-some-alternatives.html">post</a> about whether or not we really need CAPTCHA on our website forms to prevent spammers and spambots. He referred to a funny comic at <a href="http://xkcd.com">xkcd.com</a>:
