<b>Where did it come from?</b>
Some of you may hear me or "read" me saying "<b>beh</b>" from time to time. You may wonder what this is, what it means, or why I say it. If you could envision a foreigner, primarily from the Middle East, Greece, or some Eastern European country, making an audible gesture of disgust, or apathy, you'd possibly hear him or her say, "<b>beh</b>".

It's much easier for me to say "<b>beh</b>" than it is for me to say or type "I don't care. Don't worry about it. Who cares?".

Why am I writing this? I felt it was time to start explaining myself, cracking open my skull, if you will. Won't you? :D
