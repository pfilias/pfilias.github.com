I could only guess...

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/parenting/10/12/sixteen.kids.ap/index.html">16 kids</a>.

I'm VERY MUCH against this family's "family planning".

EDIT: Well, Jesse pointed something out to me. This dude was a <strong>REPUBLICAN </strong>state senator for Arkansas. Maybe they're loaded, I'm a fool, and they want to have 116 kids, paying for their care.
