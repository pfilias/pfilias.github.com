Maybe it's summer, or maybe it's just that I'm in one of my down web-cycles. I'm finding myself NOT visiting my normal sites as frequently as I normally do. These sites are <a href="http://digg.com">digg</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="http://tomshardware.com">Tom's Hardware</a>, <a href="http://newsvine.com">Newsvine</a>, <a href="http://bensbargains.net">Ben's Bargains</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://popurls.com">popurls.com</a>, <a href="http://dinofilias.com/blog">dinofilias.com/blog</a>, <a href="http://scottrouvalis.com">scottrouvalis.com</a>, <a href="http://johnturner.com">johnturner.com</a>, and the list goes on and on.

Well, this morning, I must have had a brain burp and decided to go to Newsvine to see what may be up with Israel and Lebanon and a horrid news story jumped out! <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/07/28/302689-colorado-man-says-he-commited-48-murders">Some dude in Colorado admitted to 48 murders over the past three decades</a>. I mean, I felt bad killing birds with a bb gun when I was a little kid from time to time. 48 people!! Holy shit!

On a lighter note, we've been having a dream come true in the making with Benjamin. Just watching him explore things, learn things, learn new sounds and words, get ready for bedtime with a good book to be read by mommy or daddy, etc. has been amazing!

What's been up lately?

Fireworks we did with Kim and Matt:

A Day at the Rochester Municipal Park while I was off the week of July 4th:

Oh, I am going Salmon fishing this evening, and hopefully tomorrow, for the first time in my life. I'm meeting up with Sean in Ludington (on Lake Michigan). I'm pretty excited!!
