So far, <a href="http://www.aximusers.com">Axim Users Dot Com</a> is working out nicely. I've got about 52 users on the site, and it seems that about 10 of them are active. I hope that more and more Axim users will flock to this site. I need to do something more to it to make it more attractive. I need to make a portal out of it!
