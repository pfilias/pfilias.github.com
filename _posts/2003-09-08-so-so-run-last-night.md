So we had to run 14 miles last night, but we were LAZY all day... we should have just run at 9am, when it was a cool 61 degrees. But we didn't. We just chilled out all day... in the end, we got to running so late that by the time we were done it was pitch black. It kind of sucked, as we were never really in it to win it. We ended up doing 11.16 miles instead of 14. Oh well. This week HAS to count. It's the 40 mile week. 5, 10, 5, 20. I can't wait until it's done. Then I just have the anxiety of my work review on Monday and the marathon itself... after that, it's costing all the way until the holidays!
