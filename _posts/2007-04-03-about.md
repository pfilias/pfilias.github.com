My name is Peter Filias, and I'm a geek. There, I said it. I love technology. I love pushing technology onto people when I know it will improve their lives or their business. It's that simple. My philosophy is no-frills. Just talk to me about it.

If you are interested in donating to my cause, whatever that may be, please send a donation my way and I'll see to it that it gets good mileage!
