So, I was going through this rollercoaster of figuring out which blog template I'd use. I found one at Neil's corner that is very nice and very clean. I had a few complaints recently about switching to a two column blog. The readers had to scroll left to right to view the whole blog. I reverted back to "clean", a style that Movable Type provides. Two complaints about it came rushing into my office. I quickly scoured the net and found the current theme.

I hope everyone likes it. 

Love, Peter
