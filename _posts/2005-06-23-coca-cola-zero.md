I've had the privilege to enjoy some <a href="http://cocacolazero.com"><strong>Coca-Cola Zero</strong></a> a few times over the last few days. I was a bit confused as to why Coca-Cola had two diet beverages that contained aspartame. It appears this Coca-Cola Zero product IS supposed to taste like regulare Coca-Cola but contain 0 calories!
