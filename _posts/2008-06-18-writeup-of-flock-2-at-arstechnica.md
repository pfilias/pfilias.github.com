<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080617-hands-on-flock-2-steps-up-the-social-browser-game.html">Hands on: Flock 2 steps up the social browser game</a><br /><br />I always respect the folks at <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com">ArsTechnica</a>, so I figured I'd share this nice article on Flock 2. They mention that it's still in Beta, and there are always issues with Bets, but, like the author of the article, I'm seriously considering using Flock 2 when it makes its official release. For now, I'll stick with Firefox 3.<br /><blockquote></blockquote>
