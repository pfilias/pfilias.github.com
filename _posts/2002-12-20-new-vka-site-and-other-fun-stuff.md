Finally launched the new Vintage King Audio site: <a href="http://www.vintageking.com">VKA</a>. Looking good, and they love it.

On to more important things. I should be getting my XP1800+ today. I have learned that DirectX9 is out today, so I'm downloading it now from M$FT.

I still can't get my memory to run any better than at 3-3-3-2 settings with my Asus A7N8X Deluxe motherboard. I'm hoping someone at <a href="http://www.nforcershq.com">nForcersHQ</a> forums will let me know what I'm doing wrong.

Today I'm off to a holiday party at my sister-in-law's work. Should be a good time. It's a "shop" environment, so I bet we'll have lots of fun. I've never been to a holiday party at a shop. I'm excited.

Hoping to see LOTR: The Two Towers sometime soon. I also want to see that Schmidt movie with Jack Nicholson.

Oh yeah, got HDTV from Comcast the other day. It kicks ass!!! I was all ready to watch my Thursday night NBC shows last night, and they were all reruns, and to top it off, the rerun of ER wasn't even in true HIGH DEF!!! It was from last year though, so maybe that's why. Anyway, enjoy your weekend, kiddies.
