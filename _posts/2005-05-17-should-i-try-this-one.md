It seems that Movable Type hasn't been doing a whole lot for me as of late. I'm starting to have second thoughts and have been looking at WordPress again. It sure seems like a very polished product compard to Movable Type. I'm also curious about the whole comment spam thing. I wonder if WordPress has it figured out?
