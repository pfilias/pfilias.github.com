So, this being my second try with the Baby Bjorn Active Carrier, I'm glad to say that it worked as planned. With Michelle at the gym and me having some "computer lifing" to do, what better way to meet the needs of keeping Ben close while I bash away at the keyboard doing what I do than to use the Baby Bjorn.
