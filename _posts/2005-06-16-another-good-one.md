Thanks, Waldo, for this good one!!!

There are three blondes washed up on an island. Suddenly a fairy appears and
offers to grant each one of them one wish. 

The first blonde asks to be intelligent. Instantly, she is turned into a
brown-haired woman and she swims off the island.

The next one asks to be even more intelligent than the previous one, so
instantly she is turned into a ravishing redhead. 
The redhead builds a boat and sails off the island.

The third blonde asks to become even more intelligent than the previous two.
The fairy turns her into a man, and he walks across the bridge
