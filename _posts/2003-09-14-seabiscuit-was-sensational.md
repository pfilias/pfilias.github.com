Michelle and I decided that seeing a movie after our long run was the perfect way to rest, and indeed it was! We took the advice of my brother and the general public and decided to see Seabiscuit, with Tobey Maguire and Jeff Bridges. What a sensational story, movie, and inspiration.

The movie tells the tale of a post-depression era jockey, horse trainer, and horse owner. Each of these people has a sad tale of despair during the depression. Seabiscuit, a champion race horse of that era helps to repair all of these people, and vice versa. It's a beautiful circle of love amongst these people and the horse. Each of them seems to get a little "healing" from the other, and the combinations are endless.

We left this movie feeling very touched. The story was warm and the movie was perfectly laid out. 5 out of 5 from us!
