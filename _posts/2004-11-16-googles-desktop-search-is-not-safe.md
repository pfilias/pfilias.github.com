My friend Yogi sent me this article about the Google desktop search not being very safe. They say you should only install it on a standalone computer. However, in doing so, you're not getting much value out of this tool, as you'd want to search for your "stuff" that you have on the computer that is in documents, emails, IM chats, etc.
