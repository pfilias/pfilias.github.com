I was reading ArsTechnica this morning, before work, and I ran across this fantastic list of Windows utilities. More of them are geared towards programmers and power users. If you aren't one of them, please, move along!

I use many of these but I am also excited to try some of these that I've never heard of!

Query Express
FolderShare
InstallPad
Tidy Start Menu
