I'm heading to Montana tomorrow...I can't wait. I haven't gone out West to go snowboarding since 2004. I sure hope I remember how to do it.

I can't wait for Jon to get here in Vegas. He's coming for 1 night and then heading up to Montana where we're getting together with our friends from <a href="http://www.mtu.edu" title="Michigan Technological University">MTU</a>. Should make for a very fun weekend!

Vegas has been fun, but I've been keeping it pretty conservative after losing a bunch of money the first night I was here. I won it back and then some the next day, but haven't gambled since. The conference I'm at is great...I'm gathering some great information to take back to <a href="http://www.wayne.edu" title="Wayne State University">work</a> with me.
