Here is <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=14577">an awesome article</a> about the [H] vs. Infinium Labs lawsuit.

[H]ardOCP is suing Infinium Labs. I think it's a great story, and I've been a fan of Kyle Bennet's site for a few years now. He's also a writer/contributor in <a href="http://www.computerpoweruser.com">Computer Power User</a> (CPU) magazine.

Read the article, it's pretty interesting, and the author has some great ideas about what IL should do.
