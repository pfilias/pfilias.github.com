Yesterday was a bad day. First, I broke Scott's entire website. 2nd, I was cleaning out more garbage on the web server and one of the tools the hosting company gives me decided to mess with my photo gallery and a few other mishaps. I'm quite upset about it.

UPDATE: Oh yeah, I fixed it yesterday, the 1st of November.
