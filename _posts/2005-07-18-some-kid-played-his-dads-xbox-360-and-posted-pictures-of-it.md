This is a great story. It seems that kids all over are posting stories about how they have had a chance to play the new XBOX 360 that comes out this November. The difference in this story is that the kid actually took pictures and posted them on the internet. Apparently, his stepdad just got a new job at Microsoft and had the XBOX 360 home for hardware testing! The kid played Halo 2 on it, giving its backwards compatibility a run for the money, since there are no games out for testing.
