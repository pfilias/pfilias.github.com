Well, as far as I'm concerned, the weeks is almost over. Another week of classes is done, and only 3 sessions remain. The 27th of June is my last class until September. I do have two independent study projects due at the end of August, but they don't require me to go anywhere after work, which is a nice thing. Just like last summer, I'll get to go home after work, tend to my garden, lawn, landscaping, and most importanly, my family. I always miss playing with Ben when I get home at 10pm, as that's when he's usually going to bed.

It's Father's Day this Sunday. I can't believe that I'm someone's father. Maybe it'll hit me in a few years when they hit me up for 20 bux to go and get a Slurpee and some Nerds.
