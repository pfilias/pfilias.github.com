I haven't posted anything about technology in quite some time, and I was chatting with my good friend, Norman, this morning, about "high-tech", and he pointed me to something really cool!This kind of comes on the heels of the Apple iPhone that is getting released to the American public this June, through<a href="http://www.cingular.com"> Cingular</a> (big bummer for me, I have <a href="http://www.sprint.com">Sprint</a>). The iPhone, as you may have heard, uses a touch screen for input, allowing you to do things like zoom a picture by expanding it with two fingers, or making it smaller using two fingers and "pinching" it inwards.That same technology, on a much larger scale, can be seen in the following video:<object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/QKh1Rv0PlOQ&amp;rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/QKh1Rv0PlOQ&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18079/"></a><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18079/">Related Article - Touch Screens for Many Fingers</a>
