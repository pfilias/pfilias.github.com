Let's hope I can suck down as much water as my body will hold for the next two days. You're supposed to get real hyrdrated and eat a lot of carbs and protein during the last week. I think I've been eating a good amount of carbs, but I've definitely slipped a little on ingesting protein. I am having at least two 35g protein shakes today, if not 3, and the same thing tomorrow.

As I sit here, I'd rather be at home, completely resting and getting focused...but, a guy's gotta make a living, too!
