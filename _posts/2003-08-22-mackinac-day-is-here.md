Finally! The weekend away w/ Michelle is finally here! I crawled out of bed real early this morning, grabbed my White Chocolate Mocha at Starbucks, and got into work at 6:45 A.M. Man, the commute this early is fantastic. Took about :45 minutes to get here, tops. If I could only convert to an afternoon gym schedule. Who knows, I may try it again.

I can't wait. I burned a bunch of CDs last night for the ride up. Not sure Michelle's going to want to listen to rap the whole way, but the Saab needed to have these discs inside of itself. NAS, Ludacris, 50 Cent, Nelly, Snoop, Eminem, 8 Mile Soundtrack. :D
