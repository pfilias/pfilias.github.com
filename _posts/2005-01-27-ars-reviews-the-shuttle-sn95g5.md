My favorite site takes a look at the computer I just built for myself, as did my friend, <a href="http://rouvalis.com/blog">Chris</a>, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/shuttle-sn95g5.ars">Shuttle SN95G5</a>.

In reading their review, you'll find it very concise. They explain who this machine is made for. They also give it a 9 out of 10!
