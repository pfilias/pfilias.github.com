Tonight is our final class, and it's in Greektown!!! I can't wait until it's over. Just have to finalize our paper. I compiled most of it last night, but I still need to get an introduction and a conclusion in this thing. The best thing about this class is that we had a take-home final. Through the grace of God, we're done with it. I just have to fill in the dots!
