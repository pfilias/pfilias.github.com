<a href="http://www.pcfil.com/matrix.html">ascii-movie</a> -- Dan Dobbs sent me this link today. Man, I thought the stick figure fighting Flash movie was awesome a few years back, but this is like some of the really early ASCII animations I used to do on my Commodore 64 BBS, The Snake Pit, back in the day. Thanks for the link, Dan!
