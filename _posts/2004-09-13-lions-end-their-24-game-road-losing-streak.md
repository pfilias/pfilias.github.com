They haven't won a road game since Dec. 2000. 3 full seasons of football. They finally won, 20-16, against the Chicago Bears. Good for them. Well, it came with a cost. Charles Rogers is out, indefinitely, with a broken clavicle, again!!! What a weaking!! It's tragic our best player is going to be sidelined this entire season (most likely). Damn shame. I guess Roy Williams had some nice catches, too bad I missed them.

You know, it's hard to deal with <b>5</b> fantasy leagues, <b>3</b> pick'em games, <b>1</b> survival game, and 1 salary cap game! That's <b>10</b> football games in total.
