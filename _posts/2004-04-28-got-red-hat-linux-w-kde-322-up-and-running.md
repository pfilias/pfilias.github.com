Of all the time I spent this weekend "computer lifing", all of it was spent getting Red Hat Linux 9 installed on my main desktop and getting the network card on the motherboard to work. It's not normally supported by Red Hat, as it was released after Red Hat 9 was released. I had to get a few file packages to get it to work. Then, I spent the rest of the time getting KDE 3.2.2 installed. It's very slick.

I know, I had a typo. "I weight"... funny. I fixed it in the real blog entry.

I took the direction on tweaking my space from ArsTechnica's <a href="http://www.arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/kde-3.2/kde-3.2-12.html">review of KDE 3.2.2</a>.
