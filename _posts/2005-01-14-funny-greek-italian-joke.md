A Greek and an Italian were sitting down one day debating who had the      
 superior culture.                                                          
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Greek says, "We have the Parthenon"                                    
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Italian says, "We have the Coliseum"                                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Greek says "We had great Mathematicians"                               
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Italian says, "We had the Roman Empire" and so on and so on and then:  
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Greek Says, "We invented sex!"                                         
                                                                            
                                                                            
The Italian says, "That is true, but it was the Italians who introduced it 
 to women."
