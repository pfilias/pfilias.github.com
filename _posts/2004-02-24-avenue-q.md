John and I went and saw Avenue Q this evening after work (school for me). Avenue Q was an adult audience based puppet show with puppets that resembled those of Jim Henson's world. Hilarious! Unique! I was fighting myself to stay away for a little bit of it, near the end of the first half and the very end. I don't think I fell asleep...if so, for about 1 minute, total.

Today was the longest day thus far. Got home at about 11:00PM. I'm sure we'll find something to do tomorrow night...
