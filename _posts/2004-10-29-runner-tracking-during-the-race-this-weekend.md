I was wrong about the map tracking. You can only track via e-mail. I guess it'll send you e-mail when I cross certain points.

Just go there, create an account (as required) and then search for Filias. There, you'll be able to tell it to email you when I cross the finish line, midpoint, and any other point (3 checkboxes).

The Map Tracking feature is only for spectators of the race, I guess.

This page deals with all the technology involved during this Sunday's race.

Wish me luck!!!
