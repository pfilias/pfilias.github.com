<blockquote>Dear Mr. Baker,

As an employee of an institution of higher education, I have  				few very basic expectations. Chief among these is that my direct  				superiors have an intellect that ranges above the common ground  				squirrel. After your consistent and annoying harassment of my  				co-workers and me during our commission of duties, I can only  				surmise that you are one of the few true genetic wastes of our  				time.

Asking me, a network administrator, to explain every nuance  				of everything I do each time you happen to stroll into my office  				is not only a waste of time, but also a waste of precious oxygen.  				I was hired because I know how to network computer systems,  				and you were apparently hired to provide amusement to your employees,  				who watch you vainly attempt to understand the concept of "cut  				and paste" as it is explained to you for the hundredth  				time.

You will never understand computers. Something as incredibly  				simple as binary still gives you too many options. You will  				also never understand why people hate you, but I am going to  				try and explain it to you, even though I am sure this will be  				just as effective as telling you what an IP is. Your shiny new  				iMac has more personality than you ever will.

You wander around the building all day, shiftlessly seeking  				fault in others. You have a sharp dressed, useless look about  				you that may have worked for your interview, but now that you  				actually have responsibility, you pawn it off on overworked  				staff, hoping their talent will cover for your glaring ineptitude.  				In a world of managerial evolution, you are the blue-green algae  				that everyone else eats and laughs at. Managers like you are  				a sad proof of the Dilbert principle.

Seeing as this situation is unlikely to change without you getting  				a full frontal lobotomy reversal, I am forced to tender my resignation;  				however, I have a few parting thoughts:
<ol>
	<li>When someone calls you in reference to employment, it  						is illegal for you to give me a bad recommendation as  						I have consisted performed my duties and even more. The  						most you can say to hurt me is, "I prefer not to  						comment." To keep you honest, I will have friends  						randomly call you over the next couple of years, because  						I know you would be unable to do it on your own.</li>
	<li>I have all the passwords to every account on the system  						and I know every password you have used for the last five  						years. If you decide to get cute, I will publish your  						"Favorites," which I conveniently saved when  						you made me "back up" your useless files. I  						do believe that terms like "Lolita" are not  						viewed favorably by the university administrations.</li>
	<li>When you borrowed the digital camera to "take pictures  						of your mother's b-day," you neglected to mention  						that you were going to take nude pictures of yourself  						in the mirror. Then, like the techno-moron you are, you  						forgot to erase them. Suffice it to say, I have never  						seen such odd acts with a ketchup bottle. I assure you  						that those photos are being kept in safe places pending  						your authoring of a glowing letter of recommendation.  						(And, for once, would you please try to use spellcheck?  						I hate correcting your mistakes.)</li>
</ol>
I expect the letter of recommendation on my desk by 8:00 am  				tomorrow. One word of this to anybody and all of your twisted  				little repugnant obsessions will become public knowledge. Never  				f*ck with your systems administrator, Mr. Baker! They know what  				you do with all that free time!
