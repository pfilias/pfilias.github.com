But... pretty damn expensive at $150! Not only do they use bluetooth for the actual sending of the audio signal, but they also allow you to control your iPod which is very interesting. If they only made headphones like this that were earbuds, say, based off of the Shure or Etyomic earbuds. Of course, the control option would probably be missing on something that small.
