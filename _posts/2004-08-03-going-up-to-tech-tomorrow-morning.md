I can't wait. Me, Dino, Jon, Josh, and Steve E. are going up to Tech tomorrow morning for the rest of the week/end. It's Sigma Tau Gamma Gamma Chi's 30th Anniersary! I'm pretty excited to see a lot of old friends, as well as meet a lot of our old alumni that have been signing on to the site that Dino built for our chapter, <a href="http://www.sigtau.com">Sigma Tau Gamma -- Gamma Chi</a>.

We're probably trying to pack too much in, but we're brining up our mountain bikes, possibly going a little 4-wheelin', and basically hanging out and partying in Houghton. I also have to squeeze in a 7 mile run. Should be nice, weather permitting, along the lake and around Houghton!
