A man walks into a drug store with his 8-year old son. They happen to    
   walk by the condom display, and the boy asks, "What are these, Dad? The  
   man matter-of-factly replies, "Those are called condoms, son. Men use    
   them to have safe sex." "Oh I see," replied the boy. "Yes, I've heard    
   of that in health class at school." He looks over the display and picks up  
   a package of 3 and asks, "Why are there 3 in this package?" The dad      
   replies, "Those are for high school boys, one for Friday, one for        
   Saturday, and one for Sunday." "Cool" says the boy. He notices a 6 pack  
   and asks, "Then who are these for?" "Those are for college men," the     
   dad answers, "TWO for Friday, TWO for Saturday, and TWO for Sunday." "WOW!"  
   exclaimed the boy, "Then who uses THESE?" he asks, picking up a 12       
   pack.

   With a <i>sigh </i>and a <i>tear </i>in his eye, the dad replied, "Those are for       
   <i>married </i>men. One for January, one for February, one for March......."
