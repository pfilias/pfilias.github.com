<b>Finally!</b>
It's here. The day is here to mark the rebirth of the fancy car for the Filias Family! Michelle and I are the proud parents of a 2003 Silver Metallic Saab 93 Vector with gray leather interior. The car is absolutely GORGEOUS! We are both extremely happy with our purchase. <a href="http://www.filias.com/cgi-bin/album.pl?album=2003%20Albums/07.22.2003.FinallySaab93Vector">Pictures of the beauty</a>!
