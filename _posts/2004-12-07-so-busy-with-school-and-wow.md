You know, I just don't have time to blog lately. School, work, and World of Warcraft just has me so booked, I can't even blog.

This weekend, after our Thursday night Finance Case is done, I plan to decorate the outside of the house as well as get it more "ready" for Christmas. This means to STOCK the place with candy and gifts!!!
