So, all I wanted to do at the end of last week was get <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview">Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> a quick ride around the block. Well, I tried to install it on my work PC with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/">Microsoft's Virtual PC</a>, no luck. I tried to install it with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle's Virtual Box</a>, no luck.

I don't want to have to mess around with <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/">VMWare Workstation</a> (at home) nor do I want to mess around with dual booting. I guess I'll have to give it a quick go with one of the aforementioned methods after all, though.

I had the very early version installed on my old work computer under VMWare Workstation, booted into it once and was, "meh". I wonder if the consumer preview will float my boat a little bit more. I am most curious about the mail app. Is that weak? I kind of wish they'd do with the mail app what Apple did with the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/messages-beta/">iMessage</a> OS X app and let you install a beta version.

Is the installation and testing of new OSes something people look forward to? I guess you can do the same thing with Apple if you're an Apple Developer ($99). It's not free, but for the diehard Apple Developer, it's close enough to being free. Well, maybe not, as Apple only charges $99 for their OS (IIRC).

If I do actually get Windows 8 installed, I'll write something about it.

UPDATE: I realized I missed my mark of trying to write a post every week. Hell, I didn't write a single post during the leap year month of February. Shame on me.
