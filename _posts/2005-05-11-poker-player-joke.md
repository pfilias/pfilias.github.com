Two couples were playing poker one evening. John accidentally dropped
some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them
up,  he noticed Bill's wife Sue wasn't wearing any underwear under her
dress!Shocked by this, John, upon trying to sit back up again, hit his
head on the table and emerged red-faced.

Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife
followed and asked, "Did you see anything that you liked under there?"
Surprised by her boldness, John courageously admitted that, well
indeed he did.

She said, "Well, you can have it, but it will cost you $500."
After taking a minute or two to assess the financial and
  moral costs of this offer, John confirms that he is interested. She
tells him that since her husband Bill works Friday afternoons and John
doesn't, John
 should be at her house around 2 PM Friday afternoon.

When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house at 2 PM
sharp and after paying Sue the agreed sum of $500 they went to the bedroom
and closed their transaction, as agreed. John quickly dressed and left.

As usual, Bill came home from work at 6 p.m. and upon
 entering the house,asked his wife abruptly. "Did John come by the
house this afternoon?"
With a lump in her throat Sue answered "Why, yes, he did  stop by for
a few minutes this afternoon."
Her heart nearly skipped a beat when her husband curtly
  asked,"And did he give you $500?"
In terror she assumed that somehow he had found out and  after
mustering her best poker face, replied, "Well, yes, in fact he did give me
$500! "

Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by
 saying,"Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this
morning and borrowed $500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house
this afternoon
 on his way home and pay me back."
 
 
Now THAT, my friends, is a poker player.
