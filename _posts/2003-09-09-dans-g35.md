Dan surprised us last night, wearing his Audi hat. He wanted to come by on his way home from his mom's (maybe he lied about that, too). He said come out and check out my Xenon headlights. I knew something was fishy at that point. He got a brand new silver Infiniti G35 Sedan! Awesome car! Fast as hell, and it looks awesome, inside and out. It's an automatic with an autostick that is VERY responsive. Also, it's rear wheel drive, so it really feels like it gets up and goes!!! Fantastic vehicle! Congrats, guy!
