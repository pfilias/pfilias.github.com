Have you always wondered if there was a BETTER way to make a new folder in Windows 7 (and 8)? I loathe having to right-click in my current folder and choosing New &gt; Folder. The New submenu is usually WAY at the bottom of the context menu.

I did a little digging today and found this simple post at <a title="Windows 7 New Folder Keyboard Shortcut" href="http://dailykermit.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/win-7-new-folder-keyboard-shortcut/" target="_blank">Infrequent Geek</a> with the shortcut. CTRL + Shift + N makes a new window!!
