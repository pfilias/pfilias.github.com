Let's hope this is a good week. I am going to my first of two interviews this week. It's at 11am. I really neeeeeeed to get a job. Being unemployed sucks.

Oh yeah, they must have made a grading error on my exam. Turns out, I got 43/50, and 50/50 on the project. So I got a 93/100 on my first exam, and Michelle got a 98/100...good for her, and good for us!
