Tonight, I realized that I can change my Direct3D settings to be "best performance" instead of "best image quality". Doing this, I was able to get my 3DMark score up to 13,933. Just a chin hair away from 14,000... my first main goal. Tried upping the video clock from 330 to 335, no eh eh... I did manage to change my ram timing from 3-3-3-2 to 3-3-2-2 (I think).
