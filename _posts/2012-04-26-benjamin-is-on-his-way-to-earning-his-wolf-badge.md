Benjamin earned his Tiger Cub badge on April 25, 2012. He's now officially a Tiger Cub and is on his way to earning his Wolf Badge next year!

We had a great year with all the activities. We started the year with a scouting <a href="http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=det">Tigers</a> game where the scouts got to run the bases! Family swim night. Adventure day at <a href="http://www.glcscouting.org/camping/agawam/index.html">Camp Agawam</a>. A newspaper factory tour at the <a href="http://www.macombdaily.com">Macomb Daily</a>. A sleepover in the <a href="http://www.silversidesmuseum.org/">USS Silversides Submarine</a>. The Pinewood Derby! A Photography lesson. A nature center and trail walk at <a href="http://www.metroparks.com/metroparks/parks/index_all.aspx?ID=11">Stony Creek Metropark</a>.

We're so proud of you Benjamin!!
