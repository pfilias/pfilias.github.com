I've always wanted to snag this off the bulletin board at work. Here is a VERY CLEVER play on letters!

<b>DORMITORY</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>DIRTY ROOM</b>

<b>DESPERATION </b>When you rearrange the letters: <b>A ROPE ENDS IT</b>

<b>THE MORSE CODE</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>HERE COME DOTS</b>

<b>SLOT MACHINES</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>CASH LOST IN 'EM</b>

<b>ANIMOSITY </b>When you rearrange the letters:  <b>IS NO AMITY</b>

<b>A DECIMAL POINT</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>I'M A DOT IN PLACE</b>

<b>THE EARTHQUAKES</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>THAT QUEER SHAKE</b>

<b>ELEVEN PLUS TWO</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>TWELVE PLUS ONE</b>

<b>ASTRONOMER </b>When you rearrange the letters: <b>MOON STARER</b>

<b>PRINCESS DIANA</b> When you rearrange the letters: <b>END IS A CAR SPIN</b>

And the grand finale...

<b>MOTHER-IN-LAW</b> When you rearrange the letters:  <b>WOMAN HITLER</b>

Now that's soom good "spam".
