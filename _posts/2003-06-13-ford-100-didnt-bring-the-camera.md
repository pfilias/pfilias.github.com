What a retard! I had my camera yesterday and took all sorts of pictures...in the <b>RAIN</b>!!!

Today, though, it started to clear up. On the way in, I saw 100s of awesome classic cars...should have brought the camera. What a maroon! I will bring it on Monday and go nuts with it. I haven't seen this many cool cars in one place in my life. It's actually quite amazing. I'm also going to make sure I get some pictures of all the Model T's, which are on the other side of the building.

Tomorrow is going to be a fun day. Michelle and I are going to go house crazy again. Cleaning windows, mowing the lawn, trimming, edging, etc. It's quite exciting if you ask me!

Have a good weekend everyone!
