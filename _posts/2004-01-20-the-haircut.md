This joke was sent to me by my cousin, Jenny, from Greece:

<i>A Florist goes to the barber for a haircut and when he goes to pay,
the barber says 'I can't accept any money,I am doing a community
service. The Florist is happy and leaves the shop. The next morning
when the Barber goes to open his shop, there is a Thank
you Card and a dozen roses waiting at his door.

A Cop goes for a haircut and he also goes to pay the Barber and the
barber replies: 'I am Sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I am doing a
Community Service'. The Cop is happy and leaves the shop. The next
morning when the Barber goes to open his shop, there is a Thank
you Card and a dozen Donuts waiting at his door.

A Greek guy goes for a haircut and he also goes to pay the Barber and
the barber replies:'I am Sorry, I cannot accept money from you; I am
doing a Community Service'. The Greek guy of course is very happy and
leaves the shop.
The next morning when the Barber goes to open his shop, he finds a
dozen Greeks waiting for a haircut...</i>
