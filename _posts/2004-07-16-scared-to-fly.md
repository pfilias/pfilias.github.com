Thanks, Alex, for sending me this article.

<a href="http://www.womenswallstreet.com/WWS/article_landing.aspx?titleid=1&articleid=711">Terror in the Skies</a>

Apparently, Islamic Militants are now doing dry runs of actually building explose devices IN THE AIR. A group of them will travel together and each one will bring a different piece of the bomb onboard. Then, they'll slowly put it together in the bathroom, like what these Syrian dudes were doing on the flight in that article I linked to. Scary.
