Not sure why, but C3PO is back!!!! With a vengeance, too. No idea why, but man oh man, does it hurt!!!!

I have a final exam today in my e-commerce survey course. Should go well.

We're getting ready for the baby. 6 weeks to go. House is pretty much ready for our new roommate. We can't wait!!!

My brother is pregnant. He's lifted his NDA about it. You can read more at <a href="http://www.dinofilias.com/blog">http://www.dinofilias.com/blog</a>.

Oh, I LOVE the warm weather! Can't wait to be outside a lot more. It's been a long winter, it seems.
