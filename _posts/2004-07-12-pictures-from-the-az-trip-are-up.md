Michelle and I had an absolutely wonderful time. At first, we hung out with Sean, and went up North. Northern Arizona is BEAUTIFUL!!! Reminded me a lot of Colorado. Then we went back down to the Phoenix area and hung out there, partying for July 4th in Tempe! Then we went up to Sedona, which is so beautiful, we stayed there 1 night when we were going to stay in Flagstaff, which didn't do a whole lot for us. The Grand Canyon, as you'd expect, was stunning. After our trip up North, alone, we went back down to Chandler, and hung out with Aaron, Vicky, and Sean for two more days, having a wonderful time, a bit more relaxing, and not so "on the go" as the first 5 days!
