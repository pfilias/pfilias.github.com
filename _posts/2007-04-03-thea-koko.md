My aunt Koko (Angeliki) passed away at 3AM EST. She was my mom's only sister and was such a nice and loving woman. She was always making jokes and full of laughter. She spent the last few years of her life taking care of my grandma, who passed away on <a href="http://www.peterfilias.com/2005/06/22/my-yiayia-passed-away-at-midnight/">June 22, 2005</a>.

My aunt always took care of me/us when we visited Greece w/o my parents being there.

This is an idea of her general mood!
