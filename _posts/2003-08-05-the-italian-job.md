This movie was awesome! Michelle and I saw it with her mom last night. She didn't want to go at first, but I know she would have regretted it. I think she was VERY entertained by the end of the movie. It was just a good old fashioned (in idea) robbery movie. Although, in the movie, they used some VERY high-tech methods to accomplish their two heists.

The movie was fantastic. The acting was excellent. The car chase scene was amazing!
