We sure did have a great time going to Green Bay two weekends ago to visit with the Patrickus family and attend, it seems, our annual Packers game! This time, the weather was awesome (for the game). The tailgating was a blast, but a bit cold and windy for our taste. Nonetheless, it was a damn good time.

Ben had a little too much fun!
