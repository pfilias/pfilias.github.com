To me and all my friends out there who are blessed as fathers. Y'all know who you is.

I was surprised to find Al Roker's book, Big Shoes -- In Celebration of Dads and Fatherhood, on my computer desk this morning. I was hoping Michelle or someone would get me this book for my first Father's Day.

Thank you, Michelle, for giving me the best gift a man could ask for, a child. I love you.
