Thank God for Mike. He's a trooper. He's really doing a lot of work on helping me get the server locked down. Mike, thanks a lot for all your help. It's above and beyond the free hosting and email you get for all the hard work and time you've put into this thus far!

<strong>THANK YOU MIKE!</strong>
