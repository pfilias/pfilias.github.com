<b>Oh boy oh boy!!!</b>

Watching the game last night between the Pistons and Pacers was nothing pleasant...at least not until the 4th quarter, when the Pistons finally got the lead...with a few minutes left in the game! Earlier in the game, the Pistons were shooting a mere 24%...<b>NOTHING</b> was going in. I repeat, <b>NOTHING</b> was going in!!!! Now we wait. We wait until Sunday, when the Pistons head to Los Angeles to play the league-dominating LA Lakers. Kobe, Shaq, Payton, Malone. They're supposed to kick our ass. Right? They are supposed to crush us. I hope not. I hope the Pistons win at least 2 of the games. At least that way, the Pistons can let the fans know that they are contenders. Maybe not this year, but they definitely have a foundation for a few years to come! I think Joe Dumars has done a good job putting this team together!
