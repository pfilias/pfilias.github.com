So I was about to go to bed last night at about 10:30. I fell asleep watching a documentary on HBO about the crystal meth problem in rural America. It's quite sad, actually. These people are "lost". Anyway, after dozing off, I decided to "computer life". <b>BAD MOVE!</b> I should've just gone to bed at ~10:30. Instead, I went to bed at 11:55pm. Oh well. Can't win 'em all.
