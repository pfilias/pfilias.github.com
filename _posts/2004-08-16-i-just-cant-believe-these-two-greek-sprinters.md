You know...your country is hosting the Olympics, you're both fantastic sprinters, with high potential for winning an Olympic medal. Instead of just showing up, doing what's right, you skip the drug testing (to give yourself a chance to get clean, perhaps), you lie (maybe) about being involved in a motorcycle accident...and then you get the IOC to give you a few days to defend yourself.
