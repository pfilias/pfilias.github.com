I am trying to figure out why my webserver is spitting out the CSS files as text/plain? Internet Explorer plays nice w/ others, and takes care of it, properly formatting everything I need, properly. Shit, now that I think of it, this message entry interface is using a stylesheet, and it's showing up fine in Mozilla. I don't know why my actualy blog doesn't show up properly in Mozilla.
