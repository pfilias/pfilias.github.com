Periodically, I get humongous e-mails from people who don't shrink their photos before they send them. Normally, I don't care about this, as I'm never anywhere that a broadband connection isn't nearby. However, there are some people who have mailboxes that can't receive large attachments, typically 10MB or more. So, while researching a solution to this problem, I found <a href="http://www.onthegosoft.com/shrink_pic.htm">ShrinkPic</a>. You download, install, and run this app (it runs in the background -- it automatically puts it in your registry to start when your computer boots).

The direct link to download it is <a href="http://dl.filekicker.com/send/file/224687-Y3UW/shrink_pic18.exe">here</a>.
