<b>Neophyte </b>- Comes to work on time.  Leaves a little early.  Takes long
 lunches off site.  Majority of life is still outside of work.  Has no 
 real responsibility.  Happy to do any task, like cleaning crumbs out 
 of your keyboard.  Cannot believe s/he is getting paid so much to talk 
 to college buddies on the phone and surf the Internet all day.  Life 
 is great!
 
 <b>Entry Level </b>- Arrives and leaves on time.  Feels important when boss
 asks him/her to work late and does so without hesitation.  Brags to 
 friends, "I chose the typeface for the IBM presentation".  Considers a 
 $25 bonus as indicator of undying company loyalty.  Eats at desk on 
 occasion.  Life is pretty good.
 
 <b>Worker </b>- Leaves late occasionally.  Never calls in sick just to take
 the day off anymore.  Is entirely responsible for meaningless 
 projects, like changing "Systems Group" to "Technology Group" in all 
 company documentation.  Still comes into work with hangovers. Personal 
 life is unknowingly vanishing.  Is excited by a tiny raise and small 
 promotion.  Life is good.
 
 <b>Employee </b>- Arrives early on occasion.  Leaves late fairly often.  Eats
 lunch at desk every day.  Only has 1 or 2 remaining friends outside of 
 work.  Is actually responsible for real work that, if screwed up, will 
 not damage the company significantly.  Still has time to use company 
 perks like hockey tickets.  Life is OK.
 
 <b>Level 2 </b>- Arrives early.  Usually the last one to leave.  Life is
 consumed by reports containing meaningless blocks of numbers.  Derives 
 all self-esteem from company and superiors' approbation.  Spends 
 entire paycheck on objects that elevate status and image.  Is totally 
 immersed in work and loves it.  Can do nothing but collapse in front 
 of the TV to watch 90210 the few hours s/he is home.  Life is 
 stressful.
 
 <b>Level 3 </b>- Same as Level 2 except their work actually affects the
 success of the firm.  Doesn't enjoy work anymore even though the 
 salary is obscene and it keeps them away from their spouse all day. 
 Considers quitting, but has large mortgage payment and doesn't want to 
 give up the wide screen TV.  Doesn't know what to do on a day off. 
 Life is hell.
 
 <b>Manager </b>- Tells other people what to do.  Loves the power.  Has to
 continually prove worthiness to managers up the food chain.  Always 
 works late in order to do the real work that can't be done during the 
 day.  Has 5 times as many business outfits as friends.  Home life 
 starts to break down.  Life is stressful.
 
 <b>Middle Manager </b>- Spends all day describing things with buzzwords.
 Considers key employees, pens, and contents of recycling bin as 
 resources.  Still works late, but only for a conference or client. 
 Sometimes in winter, sees the sun after it rises or before it sets, 
 unlike Level 2s, 3s, and managers.  Has no friends or home life.  Life 
 is OK.
 
 <b>Upper Manager </b>- Likes looking at reports and talking at meetings.
 Usually leaves work on time, except when leaving early to play golf 
 with other Upper Managers.  Hardly ever needs to brown nose anyone 
 anymore.  No longer owns jeans.  Cannot remember ever taking public 
 transportation.  Life is good.
 
 <b>Executive </b>- Despite having vast riches and grown children, chooses to
 come to work because it's fun.  Says things like, "We need more market 
 penetration in Liberia" and over the next few months, it happens.  If 
 it doesn't, the executive must do even more work by saying, "Why don't 
 we have market penetration in Liberia?"  Magically, it happens and 
 executive is called a visionary.  Life is great!
