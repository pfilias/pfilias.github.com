Wow, Dan!!! Thanks for sending this link along!

The UK has always liked the Commodore era. I wonder why?

Man. I remember buying Ultima V from Eaglesoft (ESI), who was from downriver or something. The craziest thing is that it played better (enhanced) on Dan's Commodore 128. I was always envious of his 128.
