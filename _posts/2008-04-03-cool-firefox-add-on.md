I just updated to the latest Firefox 3 Beta, Beta 5. In doing so, I went out looking for new add-ons and stumbled upon this one.

I'm also using another add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1730">ScribeFire</a>, which is how I'm writing this blog entry today.

A lot of this has come, my new-found interest in blogging because <a href="http://rouvalis.com/blog">Chris</a> got into blogging, again.
