I was talking to a tech at Apple this evening, explaining to him that my 1st Gen MacBook Pro has some battery issues. The crazy thing is that it's one of the recalled batteries, maybe 1 year old. I didn't think that it would have 1:48 at a full charge. Let's hope this trick helps.
<ol>
	<li>Power down</li>
	<li>Remove the battery</li>
	<li>Remove the power cable</li>
	<li>Hold the power button down for 10 seconds</li>
	<li>Plug the power cable back in</li>
	<li>Plug the battery back in</li>
	<li>Condition battery by fully charging and then using it until it is empty</li>
</ol>
