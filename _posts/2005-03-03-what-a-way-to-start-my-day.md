You know, I could've started my day off much nicer than I did today. Just as I'm getting ready to come into work, I was dealing with a few coffee drops and wiping off my coffee cup from it's small spills it endured on the way into work. Well, as I set my cup down in front of the passenger seat, the whole damn thing tipped over, spilling and soaking into the floor mat and carpet. Luckily, I'm going to the gym these days and I had my towels to soak up most of the coffee with.

Still, the carpet looks dark. I'm sure it's going to be stained, but I'll do my best to get it out with detergent. Good thing the carpet is dark gray! Oh well. Whoa is me!
