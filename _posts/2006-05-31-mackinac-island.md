We took Ben up to Mackinac Island this past weekend (Friday - Sunday morning). Had an absolutely wonderful time. We rented bikes and rode around the island, giving Ben his first bike ride, ever. Besides sleeping for about 5 of the 8 miles, he seemed to really enjoy the open road!

We had a nice time getting to visit with Frank and his family (all but little Freddy).
