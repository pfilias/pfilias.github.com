So, out of 5 leagues, I'm in the "Superbowl" for 2 of them, and in the consolation game for 1 of them (my Yahoo! Plus league). I would've made it to my Superbowl, but I played T. Hasselbeck of the Washington Redskins who did nothing but throw 4 INTS last weekend instead of playing Aaron Brooks, who threw 5 TDS. Oh well.

Here is an image playoff bracker for the keeper league that I got into through Jesse's peeps.
