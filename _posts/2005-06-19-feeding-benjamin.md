I'll tell ya. It's been a little sad having to watch Michelle feed Benjamin this whole time. I was so excited when it was finally my turn to give it a shot. Not only did he take the bottle from me without a hitch, but he sucked it down in no time.

A few days after this picture, I fed him again, and he sucked THAT bottle down even faster!
