The interview on Monday went well, I thought. I have a different interview today. Two in one week, makes me feel a bit more confident about getting out of this unemployment hole that I'm in.

I bought Michelle a 17" LCD monitor for an early Valentine's day gift, she loved it! She rearranged her whole working envirnonment. Now we just have to get that humongous laser printer off of her desk. Next up, the Shuttle SN41G2. Once I get that for her, she'll have a pretty bad-ass computing environment!
