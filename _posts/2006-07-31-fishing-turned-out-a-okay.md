So, the salmon fishing experience was a prosperous one for me. Sean was kind enough to let me bag the first of two salmon we had on our multiple trips out to sea. Greg caught the 2nd one shortly after I caught the first one. The remaining two trips out yielded no fish (I was absent from the 3rd trip out).

Other than the fishing, we had good times and good laughs...lots of them. It's always nice to see Sean, Bill, and Carlo. It was also a pleasure to meet Greg, now a resident of St. Joe/Benton Harbor.
