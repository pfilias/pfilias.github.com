I can, however, believe how beautiful she is, how smart she is, how tender she is, how exciting she is, how adventurous she is (with my help), how caring she is, how compassionate she is, and how absolutely wonderful she is!!!<p><b>Michelle, you're the best, and the love of my life!</b><p><<< Our wedding day, October 21, 2000, at <a href="http://stnicholas.michigan.goarch.org/" target="_blank">St. Nicholas, Greek Orthodox Church!</a></td></tr></table>
