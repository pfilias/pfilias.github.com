Michelle and I went with Jon and Dawn to the Fox Theater last night to see Chris Rock!
He was hilarious....for the first half of the show... he got too heavy into the Iraq war and Bush. It wasn't really his thing, I don't think. He should have just stuck with this whole black/white routine that he normally does and is splendid at pulling off.

I'm 100% happy that we went, but I would have rather seen his last tour, the one that was on HBO last year. I think it was Bigger and Blacker. This year it's called Black Ambition Tour 2003.
