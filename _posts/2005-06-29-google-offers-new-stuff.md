<a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> and <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> offer new stuff.

<b>Google Earth
</b>
Google Earth - Explore, Search and Discover

Want to know more about a specific location? Dive right in -- Google Earth combines satellite imagery, maps and the power of Google Search to put the world's geographic information at your fingertips.

<ul><li>  		Fly from space to your neighborhood. Type in an address and zoom right in.</li>
<li>  		Search for schools, parks, restaurants, and hotels. Get driving directions.</li>
<li>  		Tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings.</li>
<li>  		Save and share your searches and favorites. Even add your own annotations.</li></ul>

<b>Google Video
</b>

Now offers video playback with the Google Video Viewer (on selected search results that have had video clips uploaded).

Google's a damn good time. A bit oppressive, but a good time, nonetheless.
