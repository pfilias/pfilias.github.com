So, on my way into work today, I was thinking, "Why isn't there a desktop integration for Google Docs in the same way there is one for Dropbox?"

All it took was a 93ms search and the result was Insync! Not only is Insync the solution I was looking for: A desktop folder that is synced with Google Docs, but it can do this with multiple Google Accounts!

Taken from their site, here is some info about Insync:
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Why should I use Insync over Dropbox?</h3>
<ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
	<li>Way cheaper storage -- Google charges $0.25 per GB/year and Dropbox charges $2.00 per GB/year. That's 8x difference. Plus you can get 20GB for $5/year.</li>
	<li>Extensive sharing features...
<ul>
	<li>read/write + read-only sharing permissions</li>
	<li>nested sharing</li>
	<li>share recipients are not charged against their storage quota</li>
	<li>re-sharing permissions</li>
	<li>individual file sharing</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Multiple Google account support (personal, work, school, org, etc.)</li>
	<li>You can use Google Docs web to edit docs online</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Insync is 100% free. How do you make money?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We plan on making money via premium features. Example: secure remote wipe of local GDocs.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">What does "Perform these operations when I'm not using the application" mean?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It just means that if you are offline, Insync still has access to your GDocs to perform operations. It doesn't mean Insync has forever access. By the way, you can revoke access to Insync at any time using your Google accounts page.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">Why does Insync need access to my Google contacts?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We use your contacts to faciliate auto-completion when you are sharing.</p>

<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;">What's Insync's favorite song?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That's a no brainer.</p>
