I was once a proud owner of not only one Commodore 64, but two of them at one time. I used to run a BBS on one of them, and play games and do other things on the other one! This week, I've seen some web clips of the C64 celebrating its 25th birthday!

Here is a photo gallery of its birthday party courtesy of <a href="http://techrepublic.com/" target="_blank"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1197958631_0">TechRepublic.com</span></a>.
