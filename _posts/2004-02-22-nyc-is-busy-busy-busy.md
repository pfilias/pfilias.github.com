Oh boy! This place is nuts! Busy busy busy is all I have to say.

John took me for a whirlwind tour of downtown Manhattan. Fantastic experience, indeed. Strolled by Ground Zero, Battery Park, Wall St., and other areas. Big city. Lots of people...and it's only Sunday. I could only imagine what it's like here during the week. I'll find out tomorrow as I make my journey from John's place to the Port Authority Bus Terminal that will get me to a bus line that runs to West Orange, NJ, where my class is.

Going to have brunch in a bit. Gotta shake this damn headache though. Too many lemon drops last night!
