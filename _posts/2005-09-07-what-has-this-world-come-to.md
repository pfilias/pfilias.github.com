The other night, we were in Meijer, and this <b>hilljack </b>in her <b>faded black rock and roll concert t-shirt</b> said to her man, "It's four for $6, how much are two?"

I almost died. I wanted to <b>SCREAM </b>at the <b>TOP OF MY LUNGS</b>, "<font color="#FF0000">It's $3, you f***ing idiot!!!</font>"
