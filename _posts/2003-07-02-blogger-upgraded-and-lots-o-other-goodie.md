<b>Blogger:</b>
Sweet!!! The new Blogger! Looks pretty damn nice, and it seems to work well in my Mozilla 1.4 RC3 that I have installed here at work.

<b>Work:</b>
Finally getting our group together in the same location at work, and I even got a PC upgrade. Went from a 1.13 P3 to a 1.8 P4. I'm happy.

<b>July 4th:</b>
Kind of scatterbrained, as I'm going up North tomorrow with my brother, Danielle, Dan, April, Chris, Bahia, and my lovely wife, Michelle. I can't wait!!! Have had nothing else on my mind all week! It's going to be a first time for this group to be hanging out like this for an extended period of time...and no babies! Should be a blast!

<b>School:</b>
I got an A- in my Micro Economics class last 1/2 semester. I have an A, and 2 A-'s so far in school for a 3.8 GPA. I'm glad.

<b>Vegas:</b>
I am starting to contemplate if I can really afford to go to Vegas in August for Scott's bachelor party. It would entail taking off two non-paid days from work (I have no vacation days). I already have plans from long back to go camping the weekend before with Pepe and Sarah and Brian and Gretchen. I have to really think hard about whether or not I can make to Vegas.

<b>Mariner's Bachelor Party:</b>
We had an AWESOME time in Chicago last weekend. There are pictures up at <a href="http://photos.filias.com">http://photos.filias.com</a>. You'll find them under the 2003 Albums. There are also some video clips of the fun we had and of the annual Gay Pride Parade. There were some VERY colorful anti-gay protesters! Pretty good stuff.
