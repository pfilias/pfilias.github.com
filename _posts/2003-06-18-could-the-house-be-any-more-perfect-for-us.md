The house is awesome! Each and every day, I can't believe I finally have my own house. Every day, I can't wait to get home. I wish I had the energy to work on it every day after work or school, but I just don't. Getting up before 5:30 every day takes a toll on a brutha!

Hopefully, I'll be able to get the deck powerwashed this weekend with my father-in-law and my uncle-in-law. It'd be nice to be able to stain it on Sunday, as well... we shall see.

Work is getting better and better. More and more of my customers are <b>NEEDING</b> me. They all talk about how they are going to <b>PULL</b> me so I can dedicate 100% of my time to THEIR work. Not going to happen!
