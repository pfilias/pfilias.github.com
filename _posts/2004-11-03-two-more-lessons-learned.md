Oh yeah, I forgot to mention these other lessons:

<b>HUMIDITY</b> -- this killed me. Can't control this one, either.

<b>OBESITY</b> -- I could've been 10 pounds lighter, or even more. This year, I never dieted. I ate whatever I wanted. I thought I was doing well, since many of my runs were in record time (for me). But, in the big picture, the less you weight, the smoother you glide through the air!
