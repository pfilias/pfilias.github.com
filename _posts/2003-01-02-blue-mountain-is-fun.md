The Blue Mountain trip was a damn good time! The snowboarding was awesome on the first day, the 30th of December. On the 2nd day, the snow was very slushy, the runs were sometimes non-existent, and they started to close the ticket booths for lift tickets. All-in-all, the trip was a damn good times.
