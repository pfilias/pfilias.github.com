Okay, I'm an avid moviegoer. I live about 3/4 of a mile from a 30 screen MEGA theatre in Suburban Detroit. I would buy a subscription to the theatre if they sold one.

One of my favorite parts of going to the movies is the trailers they show before the movie starts rolling. This gets me excited about future film releases, and lets me know what to watch and what not to watch.

Lately, over the past few years, a new trend has started. First, there were <b>commercials </b>about the movie theatre before the trailers started. Then, there were <b>commercials </b>for popular products sold at the concessions stand, like Coke <b>commercials</b>. Now, there are <b>commercials </b>about the Army, automobiles, television shows, etc.

Is it me, or do we pay $5.00-$10.00 (depending on time, age, student, etc.) for a <b>commercial </b>free movie? That's why we go to the movies and NOT watch them on network television. HBO doesn't have <b>commercials </b>(except for HBO content), because we PAY for HBO (at least, SOME of us do). Why should there be <b>commercials </b>when we pay a premium price for 90 to 200 minutes of our entertainment time. These <b>commercials </b>add up to 10 minutes to our moviegoing experience.
