Well, Ben is almost 1 and he has officially had the chance to experience all the holidays in his first year of life! The past few weekends, he's had the chance to experience 2 Easters, the one that most Christians celebrate and the one that Orthodox Christians celebrate.

Here are some photos (with links to galleries) of his experience!
