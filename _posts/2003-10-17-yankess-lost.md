<a title="Yahoo! News - N.Y. Post Editorial Says Yankees Lost" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=531&e=3&u=/ap/20031017/ap_on_sp_ba_ne/bbo_ws_eager_editorial">Yahoo! News - N.Y. Post Editorial Says Yankees Lost</a>

This is awesome? The New York Post had two editorials ready to go last night. One if the Yankees won, and one if the Yankees lost. They accidentally transmitted the WRONG editorial to their printing facility!
