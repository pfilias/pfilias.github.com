Yippee!!! Firefox is almost done with their first real release. Version 1.0 is out in a preview release, and Thunderbird is out with version 0.8. They've added a global inbox, RSS reading (to read feeds like news and blogs), comprehensive data migration (for importing all sorts of thangs), and improved privacy controls!
