This is a neat little story that came onto my radar. It was actually under the top 5 Reuters Technology stories on My Yahoo's front page I have set up.

ATHENS (Reuters) - With 76 percent of Greek households owning mobile phones, interest for third-generation services is rising, the country's statistics service (NSS) said on Monday based on the findings of a recent survey.

NSS, which surveyed a sample of 4,970 people aged 16 to 74 in the first quarter, found that compared to 2003 usage of mobile phones with wireless internet access was up six percent.

I've been to Europe a handful of times over the past few years, and I've never seen more mobile phones per person (on average) in my whole life. Now, 2 years since the last time I went, I'd imagine it's even more than it was in 2002!
