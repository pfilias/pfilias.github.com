Thanks to JT$ for this one!

This is an absolutely FABULOUS commercial. I can't believe one of the Big 3 used Snoop Dogg in their commercial!

And Ford wouldn't let Eminem use their new Fusion, a sport sedan that comes out this Fall, in his video for "Ass Like That'. General Motors gave Eminem Hummers to use for his tour...too bad Ford wasn't cool with the Fusion.

Anyway, here's that Snoop/Iacocca commecial: <a href="http://detnews.com/2005/multimedia/golfbuddies.wmv">http://detnews.com/2005/multimedia/golfbuddies.wmv</a>
