So here I am. Just rehearsed what I'm going to present tomorrow afternoon at work. It's my big day. I have to shine as best as I can. I have to show these folks that I really want to be a part of this company and that I'm the man they need. I was fairly confident up until this point. I have to collect my thoughts in a very concise fashion so that I don't waste too much time with a bunch of dribble. I have to be clear and to the point.

I can't wait until it is over!
