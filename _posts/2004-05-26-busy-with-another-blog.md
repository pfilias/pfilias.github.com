I've been busy the past few days with my Blogger.com account to try and be "active" there so I can try and procure a GMail account. Now, if anyone reading this blog, by chance, has a GMail account and also has an invitation they'd like to spare, feel free to send that invitation email over to me! Thanks.

You can read some of these latest blog entries <a href="http://www.filias.com/computerninja/blog">here</a>.
