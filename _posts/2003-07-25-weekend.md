<B>Weekend!</b>
I can't wait for the work day to be over. We have a pretty busy weekend planned. Working on client work tonight, school project tomorrow, shopping in the morning, and dinner at night. Running 13 miles on Sunday and also surprising my parents, brother, and Danielle at the airport. They only think that Gina and Danielle's dad are picking them up. I also want to surprise my parents and brother with the new ride. :D
