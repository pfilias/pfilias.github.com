They have me blogging really slowly. Also, World of Warcraft has REALLY been taking up a lot of my free leisure cycles. Planning for the holidays has also been taking up some of my time.

I have to hit the books for the next 2 nights. We had a nice 2 week break between our case presentation and our final exam in Corporate Finance. Gotta crack the books tonight and tomorrow night. Also, with a death in the extende family, time is even tighter. Why do people always have to die near Christmas? Quite sad, actually. :(

<b>If I don't blog again for a while, we hope everyone has a safe and blessed Holiday Season. Be safe. Don't drink and drive.</b>
