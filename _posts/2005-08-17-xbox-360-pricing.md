When the XBOX 360 goes on sale later this year, people will have two different systems to choose from. A Core system and a Premium system. The Core will cost $299 and the Premium will cost $399. 

The Premium version adds:
<ul><li>a hard drive</li>
<li>HD Cables (which will cost you $40 alone)</li>
<li>a headset</li>
<li>a wireless controller</li>
<li>a wireless media remote control.</li></ul>
It seems these accessories are well worth it.
