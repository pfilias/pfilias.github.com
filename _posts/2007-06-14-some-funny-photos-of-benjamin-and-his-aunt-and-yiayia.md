I haven't posted much of anything on my blog lately, especially not anything technology-related. Shame on me. I'm just too enamored with my son, Benjamin, for the time being.

A few weeks ago, his Yiayia and Aunt came over to watch him while Michelle and I went out to celebrate <a href="http://tangerinetrunk.com/blog">Rae's</a> 30th birthday.

We often come home and find out that a blast had been had and that there is photo evidence!!!

See for yourself!!

You can see the rest of the fun by clicking any of those photos.
