Over at <a href="http://anandtech.com">AnandTech</a>, there is an interesting article about taking better photos. I've been getting more intrigued with photography over the past few months, and have always liked finding articles that either explain the mechanics of photography, or the "feeling" of photography and how to get better shots.
