In an interview with Matt Lauer of NBC's Today Show. Matt Lauer as the question: "Why do we still have political conventions?" Dennis Miller said that it was so that all the "schleps" who go door to door in places like Iowa have some incentive to do this work. "We'll get you into a big city, <strong>and maybe you'll get laid</strong>." That rocks!!
