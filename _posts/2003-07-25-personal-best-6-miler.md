<b>Running:</b>
Got up late this morning. Pondered NOT running until after work...but it would've been hot. I decided to bit the bullet and do it this morning. I am so glad I did. I got to use my new Times GPS Watch w/ Heart Rate Monitor! The damn watch is AWESOME!!! I put in a PR of 51:46 for 6 miles! So glad!
