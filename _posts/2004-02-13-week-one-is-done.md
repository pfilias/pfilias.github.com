Okay, week one is complete. The next few weeks are going to be tough. Partly because I'm going to NYC for about 7 days from Feb. 21 (night) - Feb. 27 (night). I probably won't be lifting then, but I will try and do a little running, especially in and around Central Park!

<b>I'm actually quite thrilled about my trip to NYC for a number of reasons.</b>

1) I will get to hang out with one of my best friends growing up, <b>John</b>, this whole time.
2) I'll get 40 hours of <b>ASP training </b>(active server pages). Very excited about that. Worked with ASP here and there over there past few years, but never had formal training. I can't wait. The training is in Parispanny, NJ, which is 28.8 miles from where John lives, which is in the East Village, Lower Manhattan. Driving will probably be a nightmare...but it'll add to the excitement.
3) I'll get to see the <b>Statue of LIberty, Empire State Building, Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square</b>, and other NYC landmarks I've always wanted to see.
4) I'll get to make my first corporate trip on <b>Ford's </b>account.
5) I'll get a chance to go to either <b>Atlantic City</b> or <b>Philadelphia</b>. I think we'll shoot for going to Philadelphia!
6) See a <b>broadway show</b> or <b>David Letterman</b>, or both!
7) Get harassed by street vendors trying to sell me <b>bootleg of movies on DVD</b>. Why bother when I can do that shit myself?

After this trip, my 2nd in a short time, I'll be heading to <b>Colorado </b>to meet up with Sean for 3 more days of snowboarding. I can't wait! That'll be Mar. 17 (night) - March 21 (evening).
