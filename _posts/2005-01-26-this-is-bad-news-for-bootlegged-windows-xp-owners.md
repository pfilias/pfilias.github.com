<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050126-4555.html">Microsoft to deny Windows Update to those who aren't validated</a>

Under the current plan, validated genuine Windows users will have unfettered access to Windows Update, and Microsoft's Download Center. Those that are not validated will not have direct access to Windows Update or the Download Center. However, "to help customers who may require more time to move to genuine Windows software," un-validated users will continue to receive automatic updates of critical patches, if their computer is configured to receive them. Per Microsoft's wording, it is clear that this may be yanked at any given time.
