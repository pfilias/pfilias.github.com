What a wonderful Christmas we had. It was so much more fun this year than it was last year, for Benjamin, and for Michelle and I. I can see how you start to regress in age and mentality when you have kids, as you start to get excited about setting up and playing with the toys the kids get! Benjamin got a Thomas the Tank Engine Wooden Train set for Christmas, and we've all been pretty excited playing with it and look forward to building it bigger and bigger. I am also looking forward to getting Benjamin a real train set, from Lionel.
