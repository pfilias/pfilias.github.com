I got my service light the other day. FINALLY. 14899 miles... it's about TIME to get an oil change. They also checked the tires to see if they were worn enough to finally swap out the tires (at a nominal cost to me) for some that have a slightly harder rubber compound. Same tire, just harder. They also set my lights to the <i>rest of world</i> setting.

This turns off the daytime running lights and allows me to have just the foglights on if I choose, as well as having the high beams on WITH the foglights, which is illegal in most states!
