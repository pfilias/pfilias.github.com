Watching the first NFL game, after class. What else to do? Whip out the laptop and computer life, wirelessly, of course. Anyway, in firing up the laptop (it's pretty much rested all summer), I went to <a href="http://mozillazine.org">MozillaZine </a>to see if anything was new from my favorite browser/e-mail client application writers.

Well, I found an excellent article they mentioned about Firefox extensions.
