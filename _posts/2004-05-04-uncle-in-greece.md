My uncle John, in Greece, my mom's brother-in-law, had a heart attack recently. My aunt Koko was the star. She's on oxygen full-time now, due to asthma. So, anyway, she took off her oxygen and gave it to John, while she diluted an aspirin for him during the attack. This pretty much saved him. He's in intensive care, but should be coming home today or tomorrow. He'll most likely have to have angioplasty, which is a non-issue these days. Good for my aunt, knowing what to do!!!

Besides that, marathon training has started. We have 27 weeks of it this year. I can't wait.

I moved to a new location at work. My environment is WAY better. I'll try and post some before and after shots in the next few days.
