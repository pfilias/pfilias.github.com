This is the pinnacle week in our marathon training! We have to run 40 miles this week! Today is day 1 of 4 for running. I have to meet with a potential client, first, so I may get home as late as 8-8:30. If I do, I think I'll have to buck up and put the headband headlight on (fun) and head up to Stony to do my run of 5 miles! Let's hope it works out. I cannot cheat myself this week like I did the last few weeks. I think I've skipped two runs and cut one short in the past two or three weeks. This can't go on for the remaining weeks! I have to get my goal of 4:00 hours.
