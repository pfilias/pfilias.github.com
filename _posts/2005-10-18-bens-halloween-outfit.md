This year, Ben is going to be a skeleton for his very first Halloween! I wasn't really into him being something real "cutesy". I thought a skeleton was a little bit more manly than some of the other outfits. No offense to anyone, I just like skeletons. I was even a wizard at the skeleton character in Killer Instinct 1 and 2 at the arcade!
