The 14th was our first play day. Michelle has class for 3 hours and Ben and I got to hang out. We first had lunch, then we went to visit Ben's cousin, Angelina, for a few hours. Ben and I also got to see our friend, Jon, who had his first baby-feeding (from a bottle) experience. It was tender.

Afterwards, Ben and I went to Costco for about an hour to return a few things and pick up a few things. It was my first time ever taking Ben out with me to run errands and visit besides dropping him off in the morning before work!

It was fun, and we both look forward to this coming Saturday!!!
