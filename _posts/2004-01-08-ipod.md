I have been intrigued by iPods since they came out. Now, they have come out with a mini iPod. this new one is 2" shorter, and slightly narrower and thinner. However, for $249, you get a 4GB device and for $299, you get a 15GB device that is more expandable via peripherals (at the moment) and has a larger screen. And...it's not THAT big. The small one is very chic, but the original design just seems to be more useful.
