I wish it was actually Friday. For some reason, this week is going to be a slow one. Not sure why, either. Maybe it's because I have lots of leisure-based thoughts on my mind. I'm already getting excited and saving my pennies for my trip out west next month with Sean. We're either going to the same area in Colorado, Boise, Lake Tahoe, or even Whistler, BC (most exciting). Regardless of where we go, I can't wait!
