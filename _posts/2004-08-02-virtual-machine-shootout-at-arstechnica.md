I've been interested in software that allows you to run a different operating system WITHIN Windows. I messed around with VMWare a few months back, running both Red Hat Linux 9 as well as Windows Server 2003, all WITHIN my running WindowsXP.

I didn't realize that Microsoft had their own offering, as well.
