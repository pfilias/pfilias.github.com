Today, something at work decided to eat my files in My Documents. I was merely trying to update my training log, which is an Excel file I keep in My Documents. Strange stuff. All of my work documents have been butchered, too. This includes some websites I work on at work. I don't get it. I did notice something strange when I first booted up and loaded Outllook XP. It gave me an error message stating that my Personal Folders hadn't been shut down properly...and then it had a progress meter. After a few seconds, though, Oulook, and all my folders, local, and remote, came up.
