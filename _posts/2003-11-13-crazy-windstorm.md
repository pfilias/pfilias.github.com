Man...what a crazy night! I think Michelle was up every 15 minutes, nonstop, all night long. Poor girl! We had wind gusts over 55 mph last night. At one point, Michelle got up and said the grill cover was off of the BBQ. I didn't think that was even possible, but this morning, on our way out to work, we found the grill cover wrapped over the entrance to the backyard. Crazy! We also found our two city garbage cans knocked over, the plastic, fold-up downspout extension blown halfway across the front yard and various other things blown around. Kind of cool! Winter, bring it on!!!! GIVE US SNOW!!!
