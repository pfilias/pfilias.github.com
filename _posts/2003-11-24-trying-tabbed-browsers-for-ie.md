I keep looking for an alternative to Mozilla and Firebird, as those seem to have slight problems with SOME websites, still. Mainly, my bank. They seem to have problems with submitting certain forms. I can't log into my bank, I can't "Show me more like this" when I search for FedEx locations, and the list goes on and on. IE is a great browser. It's fast, and it works on ALL sites, at least all of the ones I've ever thrown its way. The only thing it doesn't do is tabbed browsing. Well, I tried AvantBrowser, but that was a memory hog. Now, I'm trying <a href="http://www.flashpeak.com/sbrowser/sbrowser.htm" target="_blank">SlimBrowser</a>, which was recommended on <a href="http://www.thescreensavers.com" target="_blank">The Screen Savers</a>. I hope it works out!
