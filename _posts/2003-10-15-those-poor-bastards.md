<img src="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/images/team_logos/50x50/chc.gif" border="0"> The poor Cubbies had a 3-0 lead in the 8th inning. A foul ball that was catchable <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/baseball/mlb/specials/postseason/2003/10/14/marlins.cubs.game6.ap/index.html" target="_blank">was deflected by a fan</a> that was ruled NOT to be interference by the umpires because the fan's hand didn't go over the wall. This started a downward spiral for the Cubs for that inning. The Marlins hit a ball that should have easily been turned into a double play, but the shortstop, <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/players/6077" target="_blank">Gonzalez</a>, I think, had an error. Turned into a base hit. And it didn't stop there. The Marlins ended up scoring 8 runs. The game ended, 8-3. That just sucks. I feel bad for my good friend, Mark, who practically LIVED in Wrigley Field for the past few years. That poor bastard! Mark, I'm sorry.
