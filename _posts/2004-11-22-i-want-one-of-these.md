This is awesome. It's the first high-definition ready media player. Looks nice. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have digital audio pass-through. It has component video pass-through, so that I could pass my DVD player through it, but it only has analog audio pass through. That sucks. I'd still have to switch the stereo mode when doing this, but who cares, I guess.
