Thanks for this, Demo.

<b>From the state where drinking and driving is considered a sport  comes
a true story from Milwaukee, WI.</b>

A routine police patrol parked outside a local neighborhood bar.   Late
in the evening the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated he
could barely walk.  The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few
minutes with the officer quietly observing.

After what seemed An eternity and trying his keys on five different 
vehicles he managed To find his own car, which he fell into.  He was there for a few
minutes As a number of other  patrons left the bar and drove off.
Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was   a dry night),  flicked the
hazard flasher, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights.
He moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little and remained
stationary for a few more minutes as more patrons   left in their
vehicles.

At last he pulled out of the parking lot and  started driving slowly down
the street. The police officer, having patiently waited all this time now;
started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly Pulled the
man over and carried out a Breathalyzer test.  To his amazement,

the Breathalyzer indicated no evidence of the man having consumed alcohol 
at all.  Dumbfounded, the officer said, "I'll have to ask you to accompany me
to the police station, apparently this equipment is broken.  "I doubt it,"
said the man, "Tonight I'm the designated decoy."
