<p>Thanks, JT$, for sending me this sweet video. It's not often we get to see a video of a car chase, other than cops, through the streets and highways of Metro Detroit.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chief Designer of the GT, Camilo Pardo, being chased by a Z06 down I-94.  160mph+</p>
<p>The Z06 runs out of gas and has to get off at Middlebelt.</p>
<p>I think there's a Lambo in there somewhere, too...3 cars total.</p>
