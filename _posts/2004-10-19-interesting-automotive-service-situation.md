A few months ago, I brought our TrailBlazer into Les Stanford Chevrolet, in Dearborn, MI. There is a vibrating noise that occurs in the front end when you slowly accelerate in first and second gear. Anyway, they didn't fix the problem, and I didn't bother to call back Mike, the service writer. Anyway, what I DID do was send them a "0" on the survey that Chevrolet (or the dealership, I forgot) sent me. 

Well, when I brought the TrailBlazer back in there at lunch, he was upset that I reported a "0" on the survey and that I should've called him before doing that, as it makes the dealership's service department, and him, look bad. Well, I didn't apologize, per se, and I even went as far as asking for a loaner, since I had to bring this back after the first attempt didn't work. Well, this is when he mentioned the "0" on the survey. I asked him if that made the difference in the loaner, and he said that it was a Chevrolet policy he couldn't break. You what? <b>F him</b>. I'm in convenience with this whole thing. So, they are going to take the truck in tomorrow morning, drive me to work with their shuttle, and then I'll probably get <b>screwed </b>and they'll call me at <b>5:59PM</b> saying the vehicle is ready, since I kind of screwed them with the survey, right?
