I saw this in quick blurb in my Popular Photography magazine a few months ago and forgot about it. This would be great for those with point and shoot digital cameras.

For only 22 bux, you really can't go wrong if you're looking for a "flexible" tripod/mounting system for a camera to help you get those perfect shots. The company, <a href="http://www.joby.com">Joby</a>, is also coming up with an SLR version of this.
