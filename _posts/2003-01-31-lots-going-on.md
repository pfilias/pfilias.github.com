Hello friends. Things have been quite busy for me as of late. I've been fairly busy with some web work over the past few weeks, and have been really busy trying to get Axim Users Dot Com off the ground. It's taking off much better than I had anticipated, and as a result, I haven't been paying much attention to my <b>Blog</b>. I should at least write a little something here or there, though.

<b>Also, the funeral last weekend really hurt... hard to get going this week, but I managed, and so did the rest of my family.</b>

You know, what's going on with Iraq? From the looks of things, the U.S. is starting to get backing for attacking Iraq again. Our good friend Mr. Blair, always by our side. What a stand-up kind of guy!!

<a href="http://www.gamepc.com/labs/view_content.asp?id=sn41g2&page=1&bhcp=1">I just LOVE these Shuttle small form factor PCs!!!</a> I am DEFINITELY going to buy one for my wife, Michelle. She deserves it. She deserves a sleek and sexy PC to use. I don't want her to have to have a midsize tower, or even a big 19" CRT. She deserves this SFF PC and a 17" LCD soon. Just gotta get a job!!!

And on that note, I have two interviews next week. Let's hope something good comes of it.
