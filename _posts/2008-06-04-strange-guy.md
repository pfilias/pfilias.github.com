On the way back from my new daily walk, a guy got off the bus with a bag over his shoulder and a huge suitcase. He looked like he was from out of town, and he even mentioned "he wasn't from around here." I found it kind of odd, his urgency to find a Catholic Church. After I started going on about Woodward being a good option for finding a Catholic Church (we were on Cass, just south of Warren Avenue), he pointed to a church south on Cass, and I told him it was a Christian church. He said "that'll do" and started walking towards it. I wonder why he needed a church so bad?<br /><br />Someone at work said that he may have needed shelter. From the size of his suitcase, maybe it was all his belongings, and he actually did need shelter, although, he did look pretty put together.<br />
