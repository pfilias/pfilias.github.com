<b>Milan race day came and went!!!:</b>
It was awesome!!!

All I can say is that I learned a few things about launching and reaction times, and I learned that low profile tires aren't that great for drag racing. I learned that a Corvette Z06 is fucking awesome! There was a guy there with his, it only had 3,000 miles, and he ran 12.652 for his best run of the day...against me! It was thrilling to see him do so well!

Here's a picture of my 13 runs (data). <img src="http://www.filias.com/peter/milan.gif">
