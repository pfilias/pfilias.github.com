I was playing around with Ben yesterday, when I noticed the sun was setting (in the back of our house) and it was casting some really cool shadows on his face. I quickly grabbed the camera and started shooting. I have posted some of these photos is my photo gallery under 2005 (link is in the right column), and here: <a href="http://photos.filias.com">http://photos.filias.com</a>. You'll need to either register for access or know the public password.

NOTE: The photo gallery can now be accessed directly by going to <a href="http://photos.filias.com">http://photos.filias.com</a>. All old links you may have memorized or bookmarked should still work.

<a href="http://filias.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&g2_itemId=21203&g2_imageViewsIndex=1"><img class=photo src="http://filias.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=21245&g2_serialNumber=2" alt="The sun setting on Ben's face" /></a>

EDIT: I decided to upload a color version of this B&W shot:
