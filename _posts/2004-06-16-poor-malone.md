I DO feel bad for Karl Malone.

From Reuters:

<i>Malone agreed a $17.5 million pay cut in the off-season to take a chance at winning his first NBA championship by signing with the Lakers. His dream faded away Tuesday, sitting on the bench in his street clothes as the Detroit Pistons destroyed the Lakers 100-87 in Game Five to take the NBA finals 4-1.</i>
