Be sure to choose Detroit 05 2003. I am bib 900 and Michelle is bib 901. It's a shame, she always gets gipped on the finish line photos, every single time, and she's done 3 marathons! I feel bad for her. I wish she had a nice finish line photo to hang on the wall. We'll just settle for that really nice shot of the two of us, standing proud with our medals, happy that we're done with our 2nd marathon together!
