I think Michelle and I are getting an upgrade for our home laptop. Well, it's my developer laptop, too! We are selling our Latitude C810 and are replacing it with a Gateway 450ROG with a 1.3GHz, Centrino, 256MB Ram (upgrading to 768MB), 20GB HD, CD Burner/DVD Player, 15" 1400x1050 display, and an ultra thin chassis at 1.3". I know, there are some others out there toting less than 1", but I just can't handle a 12" screen and 1024x768 resolution...although, it sure makes for a nice kitchen computer at that size! I had to order myself an AC Adapter, as it came with a Compaq adapter that wasn't made for this Gateway! More to come...maybe I'll post a picture of it in coming days!

<strong>Laundry Room</strong>
We're getting there. Hung the blinds, changed the light switch and electrical socket, built the two cabinets. Today, we finish the cabinets by hanging them, with my father-in-law's help, as well as hooking back up the washer and dryer! I can't wait until it's over!
