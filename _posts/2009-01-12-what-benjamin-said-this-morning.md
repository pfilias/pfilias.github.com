My youngest son, Christopher, heard Benjamin and I getting ready this morning and woke up. Upon waking up, he started crying because he probably felt like he was missing the action. Benjamin looks at me and says, "I'll take my guitar in Christopher's room and sing him a song!"

I had to write this down after talking with my cousin Lilly on the phone!
