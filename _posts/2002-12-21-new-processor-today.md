I got my XP1800+ today. AIUGA stepping, factory unlocked! I thought it would be, but I'm happy that it's verified. Also, this TBred is kind of neat, as the core is smaller than my Palomino's, and the core doesn't have writing on it anymore. Instead, they have a black rectangular bar that has all the information on it. Apparently, it's a week 49 2002 chip, if I'm reading the 0249 properly.

The holiday party at the shop was a damn good time this afternoon. Good eating, drinking, and socializing!
