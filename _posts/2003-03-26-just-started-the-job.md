I have started the new job. It's a little bit slow at first, but what do you expect...I'm getting trained and I'm sharing a cube and a PC.

I HOPE my request for a new PC comes through...if not, I'm going to have to fight hard to get some more memory in this thing, as it only has 128MB of ram and running Windows 2000. If not, I'll have to install my own memory, as 128MB of ram is just WAY too slow for me.

I'll feel MUCH better when the first six months is up and I actually get hired direct. Then...my life will be on cruise control, in terms of a job, I hope.
