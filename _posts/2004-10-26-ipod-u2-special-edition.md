I was poking around <a href="http://gizmodo.com">Gizmodo </a>and saw this. Looks pretty slick, but it also reminds me of the Viking Gym that recently closed, on 8 Mile Road.

I love my silver iPod Mini. However, if I were to get a full-size iPod, I'd consider this one. Black is too cool to pass up!
