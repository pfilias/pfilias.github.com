Looks like we won't have to buy our own TiVo for cable! <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news/posts/1070557995.html" target="_blank">Comcast to add DVR to their set-top boxes!</a> Hopefully, it'll also record HBO. It'd be swell if it recorded HDTV, but I doubt it, as TiVo doesn't even have an HD DVR yet.
