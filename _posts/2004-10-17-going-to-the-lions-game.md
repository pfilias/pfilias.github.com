Michelle and I are going to the Lions game. It's my second game at Ford Field, and Michelle's first. The only other game I went to was with Pepe, and we sat at the roof of the endzone. Good times, for certain, in Packerland. Today's seats are at the 40 yard line, 41st row. I'm excited to sit in some good seats at Ford Field, and excited to take in a football game with Michelle. Thanks Dr. Pappas for hooking up the tickets!

On a side note, I've run 0 of 28 miles this week. Weather permitting, I'll do 12 miles...but I'm just not feeling like it.
