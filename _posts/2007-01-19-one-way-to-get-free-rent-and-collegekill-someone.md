I am 100% against this. So this kid shoots and kills a man, goes to prison for 8 years, and gets to come out, have an apartment in Bay City paid for and has his schooling at Delta College paid for, FOR THE NEXT 4 YEARS!

I mean, why? Some people can't afford to pay for rent, food, clothes, etc., let alone for 4 years of college!
