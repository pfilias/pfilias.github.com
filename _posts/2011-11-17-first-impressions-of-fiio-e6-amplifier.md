So I've been listening to my <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/headphones/sennheiser-hd-570/1707-7877_7-6899578.html">Sennheiser HD570 headphones</a> at work a bit more as of late and I always felt they could use a little bit more oomph in their sound. I was looking around Amazon.com the other day, trying to help someone at work find some headphones for a gift purchase. In doing my research, I found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/FiiO-E6-Headphone-Amplifier-Micca/dp/B005JT8OT6/ref=pd_rhf_gw_p_t_1">Fiio E6</a> that is distributed by Micca, who provides a Y-cable in the packaging.

After listening to them for a few hours with low volume (25% or less through the PC) through my cheapo Dell desk speakers, I wasn't <em>SUPER</em> impressed. I think you need to turn up the volume to <strong>50% or higher</strong> to really get a good idea of how the E6 performs. I then switched to the Sennheisers and pumped up the volume to 50% (I'm using <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> as my music player and listening to some <a href="http://arminvanbuuren.com">Armin Van Buuren</a> State of Trance 500 album). Cycling through the 4 EQ settings, I'm able to:
<ol>
	<li>Hear the difference between them all and</li>
	<li>Truly benefit from 3 of the 4 settings: Neutral (still amps the signal), +3dB, +6dB, and -3dB.</li>
</ol>
I've never heard my Sennheisers sound this full of life before.

All in all, I think this was a great $24.99 spent at Amazon.com and I'd highly recommend this to anyone who has felt they could tweak their headphone listening a bit.
