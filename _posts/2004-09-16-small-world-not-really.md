Okay, I usually remember a face, but not always. What I did remember about this one homeless guy Michelle and I met a few months back was his teeth!

Dan's friend, Ryan, is getting into photography, and has this project he's working on called <a href="http://snowsuit.net">The Snowsuit Effort</a>.

Anyway, I was going through Ryan's site and saw a <a href="http://snowsuit.net/index.php?page=93">picture and name that sounded familiar</a>!
