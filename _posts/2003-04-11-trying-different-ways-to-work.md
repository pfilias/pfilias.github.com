So I tried a new commute to work today. :) I took I-75 to I-94. Worked out very well. I think it was my fastest commute yet, considering I got onto I-75 at Rochester Road instead of just taking Mound down to I-696. I <b>HAD</b> to get my White Chocolate Mocha from <a href="http://www.starbucks.com">Starbucks</a>

Getting pretty excited about this whole house thing. Life is full of ups and downs, me guesses.

I can't believe I'm getting my LCD monitor today. I just ordered it yesterday, thought it was going to ship on or before April 15. Didn't think it'd ship on the day it was ordered. Dell is too <b>BIG</b> for that!!! Good thing they have a distribution center in Indiana!

Now I just have to sell my two monitors, and get the Shuttle boxes ordered!

Have a good day for now...it's kind of early.
