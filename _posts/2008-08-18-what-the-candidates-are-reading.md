This jumped up on <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a> a bit ago...a link to what Barack Obama and John McCain are reading. I wasn't surprised by their lists.

Barack:

McCain:

To me, DailyKOS is like DailyPOS and Huffington Post is just plain garbage. I won't even link to them.

I was glad to see that McCain read <a href="http://thedrudgereport.com">The Drudge Report</a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com">FoxNews</a>, and <a href="http://www.jibjab.com">JibJab</a>!
