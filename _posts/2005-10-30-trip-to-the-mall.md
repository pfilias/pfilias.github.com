Michelle and I were about to leave her parents' house when Kim came to pick up Louie. After visiting for a few more, we decided to leave the boys (Ben and Louie) and go to the mall to get some makeup for Kim's costume party the following night. I also had to pick up some computer parts at Micro Center. Sounded like fun. Well, we stopped at Big Shots (the old Shhh...Booms) to see if Julie was working. Well, she was, and a few beers later, we decided to finally hit road. Well, we stopped at one more bar and this time, we were looking for Louise. We didn't find her, but we found another beer and some greasy bar food. We FINALLY made it to Marshall Field's, where Kim picked up some lipstick and eyeliner.
