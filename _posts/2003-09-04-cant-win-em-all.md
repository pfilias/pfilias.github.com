So, here is the update on my order with Best Buy, oh well:

<b>Dear Best Buy Customer, 

Thank you for your recent Sony notebook order. 

A recent error on our web site allowed you to place an order for the Sony VAIO Notebook, model number PCG-GRV680 for $300.00. The promotional price for this item was $2099.99 ($2399.99 - $300 instant savings). Due to the nature of this error and in accordance with our Errors on Our Site policy contained within the Conditions of Use, your order that included this item will be canceled. You will receive an email confirming the cancellation of your order within 24 to 48 hours. Due to system issues, if your order contained additional products other than the Sony notebook, those items will need to be re-ordered. We apologize for any disappointment or inconvenience this cancellation may cause. 

For your inconvenience, we would like to provide you with a special one time, one use offer. Information regarding this offer will be provided to you via email within 7 to 10 days. There is nothing additional you will need to do to receive the special offer so there is no need to contact Customer Care. 

Thank you for your understanding. 

Best wishes from Best Buy,
