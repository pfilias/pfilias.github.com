I had a slightly slow start...getting situated and all, but I am here and ready to work. Setup was quick simple. All I had to do was tell my OS, Windows XP Pro SP1, to allow my connection without WEP to the Panera wireless network on Hall Road, in Shelby Township, MI. I had to go through an acceptable use policy, accept it, and then move out onto the public internet. Pretty cool, if you ask me. It's even cool that the first thing it presented me with was a policy I had to agree to before "unlocking" me to the world!
