Pixoria makes a product called Konfabulator, a widget system that used to be exclusive to the Apple Mac OS.

Yahoo!'s very quick and already has a site up and running with their new acquisition:
<a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com">http://widgets.yahoo.com</a>

Seems like they are like Google, but not as fast. They recently bought <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, too, a photo sharing system.
