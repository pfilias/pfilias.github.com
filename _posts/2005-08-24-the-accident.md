Thanks to Mike's wife for this:



<blockquote>The Accident 

 A woman and a man are involved in a car  accident on a snowy, cold 
 Monday morning; it's a bad one. Both  of their cars are totally 
 demolished but amazingly neither of  them are hurt. God works in 
 Mysterious ways.
 
 After  they crawl out of their cars, the woman says, "So.... you're a 
 man.
 
That's interesting. I'm a woman. Wow, just look at our cars!  There's 
 nothing left , but we're unhurt. This must be a sign  from God that we

 should meet and be friends and live together in peace for the rest of 
 our days".
 
 Flattered,  the man replies, "Oh yes, I agree with you completely, 
 this must be a sign from God!"
 
 The woman continues, "And look  at this, here's another miracle. My 
 car is completely  demolished but this bottle of wine didn't break. 
 Surely God wants us to drink this wine and celebrate our good 
 fortune." Then  she hands the bottle to the man.
 
 The man nods his  head in agreement, opens it and drinks half the 
 bottle and  then hands it back to the woman. The woman takes the 
 bottle and  immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the
 man.

 The man asks, "Aren't you having any?" 
 The woman replies, "No.  I think I'll just wait for the police...."
  
 MORAL OF THE STORY: 
 
 Women are evil. 
 
 Don't  mess with us!</blockquote>
