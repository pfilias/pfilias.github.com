<a title="First HDR image! by pfilias, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfilias/2604655754/"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3141/2604655754_9271809a66.jpg" alt="First HDR image!" width="500" height="375" /></a>

I have been fascinated by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">HDR images</a> I've seen over there years, and I've always wanted to try to create some myself. This one, I took with my handy-dandy Canon SD1000. I just used exposure compensation by putting the camera in manual mode and mapping the print button to the exposure controls. I took (5) images at -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2 EV and used <a href="http://www.hdrsoft.com">HDR Soft's Photomatix Pro</a> 2.5.4 on the Mac (PC version exists as well).

One of the tutorials I've read is <a href="http://stuckincustoms.com/2006/06/06/548/">this one</a>, which goes through the process and has some dazzling images to feast your eyes upon as well. Here is another <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/how-create-hdr-photos-hdrphotomatix-tutorial">tutorial</a>.
