I've FINALLY gotten onto the jailbreaking bandwagon with my iPhone 4 on iOS 4.0.1 and my iPad on 3.x (forgot which one).

To jailbreak, simply go to <a href="http://jailbreakme.com">http://jailbreakme.com</a>. (<strong>YOU MUST HAVE iOS 4.01 or LESSER</strong>). This <strong>WILL NOT</strong> work on iOS 4.0.2. I repeat. <strong>THIS WILL NOT WORK</strong> unless you have <strong>4.0.1</strong> or lesser.

This is the information I shared with a friend that I thought was worthy of its own page.

Here is what you need for phone.

Go to Cydia &gt; Manage &gt; Sources.
Add <a href="https://cydia.hackulo.us/" target="_blank">https://cydia.hackulo.us</a>

Get Installous from Cydia
Installous uses the hackulous repository to get stuff.

When you use Installous, you'll find apps you want, and then click download. From there, it's 11% dirtier to get apps as you have to drill through a screen or two before the download. Make it so that Installous automatically installs and deletes downloads.

Anyway, for fun stuff on the phone, get these from Cydia:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Alit</strong> - pretty cool boxy theme</li>
	<li><strong>AppSync for OS 4.0 </strong>- I guess you can do some kind of app syncing with Installous. I haven't needed to do this.</li>
	<li><strong>Activator </strong>- usually autoinstalls with other packages that use it.</li>
	<li><strong>AT&amp;T Carrier Logo</strong> - the one with the Dewalt Drill icon, replaces AT&amp;T Logo in status bar</li>
	<li><strong>biteSMS </strong>- it's a trial, eventually you buy it for 8 bux.</li>
	<li><strong>Five Icon Dock</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Five-Column Springboard</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Glasklart HD </strong>- cool theme<strong>
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Installous - </strong>let's you get "unofficial" iTunes apps</li>
	<li><strong>iWipeCache </strong>- for some themes that can somehow create icons. You'll have to research this</li>
	<li><strong>MP2-iOS4 </strong>- awesome theme, but doesn't fully work on iPhone 4</li>
	<li><strong>MyWi 4.0 </strong>- mobile hostpot. Trial, then $20</li>
	<li><strong>PDF Patch</strong> - what iOS 4.0.2 fixes</li>
	<li><strong>SBSettings </strong>- awesome toolbar that you activate by swiping across the top status bar of your phone. Click <strong>More </strong>inside of it for more settings</li>
	<li><strong>sbsettingstoggles </strong>- goes with SBSettings</li>
	<li><strong>SMS Counter 3</strong> - trial. Pretty cool</li>
	<li><strong>StatusBar </strong>Dots - forgot why I got this.</li>
	<li><strong>WinterBoard </strong>- how you install themes and it has some cool little settings. You go into <em>Select Themes</em> w/in the Winterboard app to choose themes you've downloaded and certain features of the UI to change.</li>
</ul>
