Yesterday, leaving D.C., we thought we'd try Mapopolis (GPS navigation software) in generating a route home. It was WAY wrong. It led us south into Virginia, way too far. We had to make our way back, manually, per se, bringing us through W. Virginia. The bright-side was that we got to see some gorgeous Fall colors. However, the net result was an extra 65 miles!!!
