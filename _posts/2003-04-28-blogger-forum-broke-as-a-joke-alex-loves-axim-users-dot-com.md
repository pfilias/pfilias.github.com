Ick. Tried to go to Blogger's discussion board...XML error. That stucks. Was curious to see how that shit was working out for everyone.

Just talked to Alex. He's real proud of my Axim Users Dot Com site... hopes it continues to take off. He's on his way home from San Diego this Wednesday. It'll be good to have him back, for sure.
