I brought my fun headphones back to work. I forgot that I had such fun headphones. I was laid off last year, and packed up all my stuff. I'm starting to get back into listening to music at work, so I'm trying everything to make sure I don't lose my music focus. What better way than to listen to some jams with my ghetto blaster headphones!
