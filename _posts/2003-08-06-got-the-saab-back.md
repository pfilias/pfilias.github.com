So, after having the Saab in the shop since last Friday morning, we finally got it back. They programmed the HomeLink rearview mirror on button number 2. Strange. I wonder if button number 1 doesn't work? Oh well??? They rubbed out the scratches on the trunk lid, they <b>seem</b> to fixed the rattling doors, about 90%, anyway. I heard a faint rattle on the way in to work this morning when I was listening to WWJ 950 AM kind of loud. Maybe the baritone voice of the newscaster was just too much? Who knows. And I guess they replaced the OnStar VIU. I haven't read the paperwork yet. Anyway, I forgot how much I love the car since I haven't driven it since last Thursday!!!
