My favorite site, <a href="http://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a>, has a more professional look. They have made it much more streamlined, less ads, at least it seems, and they've done some really cool things with stylesheets, allowing people to change the overall look back to the black background. You can also increase or decrease the text size, and also widen or narrow the reading area.

Very impressive!
