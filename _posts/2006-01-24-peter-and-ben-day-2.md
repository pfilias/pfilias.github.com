Well, this Saturday was Peter and Ben day #2. We had a blast. We played. We went to my mom and dad's house, where I was able to fix their furnace with the help fo Dino and his neighbor, John, who gave me some tips as to what to look for in their furnace. It kept starting up and then shutting down, immediately. I had to lightly sand off this little metal "finger" that acts as some sort of sensor. I was so happy it was something I could do! I just wish I could fix my burping toilet!!! DOH!

After that, we went home and ate our lunch and then just played, waiting for Michelle to come home from school. This time, Ben was actually able to take a decent nap, unlike last weekend, when the bass-fest was going on!
