Michelle and I had the pleasure of having our first golf lessons of our life on Saturday morning, after our 10 mile run! PHEW! <a href="http://www.bobmenzies.com">Bob Menzies</a>, one of our first website clients, gave us his promised complimentary lessons! We're so excited about it, that we're going to go and get a few more lessons so that Michelle can be a decent player at her outing for work later this month, and I can eventually go and play 9 or 18 holes and not be a complete tool!

Bob was very patient, very thorough, and extremely professional! This guy knows what he's talking about!

He was awesome. He used his video camera along w/ the NEAT swing analysis system. He drew lines to show us if we were swinging properly, standing properly, and following through properly. He did a split-screen to compare our swing and stance with Tiger Woods, Bob's opinion of the best golfer in the universe! Again, I was basically flabbergasted at the end of the lesson! He improved our swing incredibly, and that was just with a 1/2 hour lesson, each. He had us use the 7 iron only, too. After our lesson, I whacked a few with a borrowed driver from the shop at Mulligan's.
