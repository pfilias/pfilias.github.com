I am doing a lot of things to try and get <a href="http://www.aximusers.com">Axim Users Dot Com</a> to have more and more traffic. I tweaked the Meta Description yesterday, so I'm hoping that will help get me back onto page one when one searches for "Dell Axim" on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. We can only hope. The Google ads are really starting to pick up. I'm hoping they will be a viable alternative to making ad deals with some of the vendors I have. It's sometimes hard to live up to the expectations of having high traffic to promise/give them. I almost feel bad when there are lulls in the traffic to the site.
