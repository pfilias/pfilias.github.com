We must remember to be very quiet while visiting Arlington National Cemetery!

In no way do I mean for this to be disrespectful! Michelle and I thought that Arlington National Cemetery was absolutely beautiful. We visited with the utmost respect and kept our voices down, praying for the souls that have been laid to rest there.
