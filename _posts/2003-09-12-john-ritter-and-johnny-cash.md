I'm not a huge Johhny Cash fan, although some of his songs are kind of "neat". I am, however, a John Ritter fan, of sorts. I remember watching Three's Company while growing up. Hilarious show. If I only had more adult in me at the time, I would have understood more of the adult humor the show was throwing out at us!
