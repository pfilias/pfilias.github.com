My friend, Yogi, sent me this!

<img alt="talkinggull.gif" src="http://peterfilias.com/archives/talkinggull.gif" width="400" height="300" border="0" />

I couldn't get this image to save as an animated GIF, with the bird with the open mouth having its beak open and close real quickly. :( But you get the idea. Damn Outlook, wouldn't let me save the image as anything but a BMP file. So still it is.
