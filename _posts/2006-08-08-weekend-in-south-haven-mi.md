Michelle, Benjamin, and myself had a wonderful weekend in South Haven with our good friends, Dave, Sarah, and Ellie!

The weather was great, the drive was great, the food was great, the lake was great. I can't think of anything that was bad. Oh wait, someone left a July 2005 Playboy magazine in our nightstand and they didn't do maid service on Sunday. Other than that...great times!
