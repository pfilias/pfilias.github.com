<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050117-4529.html" title="EA's 15 year deal with ESPN">EA <> ESPN Deal</a>

First, I thought it was nuts that the NFL would even do a deal like the one they did with EA, locking EA Sports into having exclusive NFL rights for five years. This was a big blow to ESPN NFL 2K5 fans. It was only 20 bux. Say goodbye.

Now, EA has wiped ESPN Video Games out completely with this 15 year deal!
