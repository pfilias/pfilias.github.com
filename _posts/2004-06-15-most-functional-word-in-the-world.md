From my friend, Tortilla Man:

<i>Well, it's <b>shit</b>... that's right, <b>shit</b>!

<b>Shit </b>may just be the most functional word in the English language.

Consider:
You can get <b>shit</b>-faced, Be <b>shit </b>out of luck, or have <b>shit </b>for brains.

With a little effort, you can get your <b>shit </b>together,
Find a place for your <b>shit</b>, Or be asked to <b>shit </b>or get off the pot.

You can smoke <b>shit</b>, buy <b>shit</b>, sell <b>shit</b>, lose <b>shit</b>, find <b>shit</b>, forget <b>shit</b>, and tell others to eat <b>shit</b>.

Some people know their <b>shit</b>, while others can't tell the difference between <b>Shit </b>and Shine-ola.

There are lucky <b>shits</b>, dumb <b>shits</b>, crazy <b>shits</b>,

There is bull <b>shit</b>, horse <b>shit </b>and chicken <b>shit</b>.

You can throw <b>shit</b>, sling <b>shit</b>, catch <b>shit</b>, shoot the <b>shit</b>, or duck when the <b>shit </b>hits the fan.

You can give a <b>shit </b>or serve <b>shit </b>on a shingle.

You can find yourself in deep <b>shit </b>or be happier than a pig in <b>shit</b>.

Some days are colder than <b>shit</b>, some days are hotter than <b>shit</b>, and some days are just plain <b>shitty</b>.

Some music sounds like <b>shit</b>, things can look like <b>shit</b>, and there are times when you feel like <b>shit</b>.

You can have too much <b>shit</b>, not enough <b>shit</b>, the right <b>shit</b>, the wrong <b>shit </b>or a lot of weird <b>shit</b>.

You can carry <b>shit</b>, have a mountain of <b>shit</b>, or find yourself up <b>shits </b>creek without a paddle.

Sometimes everything you touch turns to <b>shit </b>and other times you fall in a bucket of <b>shit </b>and come out smelling like a rose.

When you stop to consider all the facts, it's the basic building block of the English language.

And remember, once you know your <b>shit</b>, you don't need to know anything else!

You could pass this along, if you give a <b>shit</b>. Or not do so, if you don't give a <b>shit</b>!

Just wanted you to know that I do Give A Shit and hope you had a nice day, without a bunch of <b>shit</b>.

But if you happened to catch a load of <b>shit </b>from some <b>shit </b>head........


Well, <b>shit </b>happens!</i>
