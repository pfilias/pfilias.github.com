New server!!! We got our server upgraded at around NOON EST today! We got our processor speed doubled, from a 1GHz AMD Duron to a 2GHz Celeron. It went from 2 bogomips to 4 bogomips. We also had our storage increased form 30GB to 40GB. We had our memory quadrupled from 128MB to 512MB. This is going to be our biggest gain in performance, for certain!!! I am so happy!

Sorry I've been out of the BLOG circuit these past few days. Been a little mentally "booked".
