Okay, so I take the Saab back to Belle Tire yesterday to get my wheels back, once and for all... Guess what? They called me saying the wheels came back and they weren't fully refinished. I had to go back there and get my car, with the nasty chrome Pulse wheels that wobble at high speeds.

What a nightmare. So, to save about $80 by ordering tires online and having them mounted locally, I ended up spending at least 4 hours of my time to get the tires mounted and now the Saab OEM wheels fixed. <b>Lesson learned!</b>
