I seem to have had a problem publishing my last blog entry using w.bloggar. I was using version 3.03. My webhost made some changes to my web server software on Friday night that may have affected my ability to use w.bloggar 3.03 to post my blog entries.

Let's see if version 4.00 from bloggar's <a href="http://www.wbloggar.com">site </a>will fix it.
