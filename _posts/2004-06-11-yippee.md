The <b>Pistons</b> won at home, in a HUGE way! They crushed the Lakers, 88-68. Unfortunately, in my moving to the bedroom for the 4th quarter, I fell asleep with about 6 minutes to go!!! Damn it! I woke up to the post-game interviews...and barely! Oh well. I know that next time, I need to stay out in the living room, where the game is in HD, anyway! Anyway, I'm so glad we have a 2-1 advantage with 2 more home games to go! <font color="#0000FF"><b><a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/mymod/hdln/aprs/sty/*http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=531&e=1&u=/ap/20040611/ap_on_sp_ba_ga_su/bkn_nba_finals">Go Pistons!</a></b></font>
