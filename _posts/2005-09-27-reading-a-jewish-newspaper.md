Alex sent me this one to make it "even":



<blockquote>A story is told of a Jewish man who was riding on the subway reading an Arab newspaper.



A friend of his, who happened to be riding in the same subway car, noticed this strange phenomenom. Very upset, he approached the newspaper reader.



"Moshe, have you lost your mind? Why are you reading an Arab newspaper?"



Moshe replied, "I used to read the Jewish newspaper, but what did I find? Jews being persecuted, Israel being attacked, Jews disappearing through assimilation and intermarriage. Jews living in poverty."



"So I switched to the Arab newspaper. Now what do I find? Jews own all the banks, Jews control the media, Jews are all rich and powerful, Jews rule the world. The news is so much better!"</blockquote>
