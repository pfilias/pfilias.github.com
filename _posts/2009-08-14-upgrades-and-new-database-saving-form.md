I upgraded my <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> to 2.8.4 (security, mainly) and found <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mm-forms/">MM Forms</a>, which is just like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/">Contact Form 7</a>, but lets you save the form submissions to the database as well as export out the data. This could be very useful for some people.
