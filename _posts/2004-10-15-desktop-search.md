Okay, so I've been using <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google's Desktop Search</a>. It's pretty neat. Not sure how often I actually need to search on my computer, but I guess I know that if I need to, I can do it. It works quite well. However, they need to add more indexability to their product. It only idexes a small amount of applications. Mainly, people would like to be able to search their other IM clients chatting activity, as well as <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla </a>products, Firefox/Mozilla and Thunderbird. Also, they need to support other OSes, like Mac, and maybe even Linux.

We'll see. I'm sure Google's plight will continue. Who knows, maybe one day we'll have GoogleOS. Wouldn't that be wild?
