Not to be confused with some "other" white hoods, Ben's little hooded sweater was so damn cute, we had to take some pictures of him. It's also important to note that many of Michelle's fall and winter apparel is hooded! She LOVES hoods!!!

In recent weeks, it seems that Ben likes to take a hold of books. I wonder if he's getting "used" to that feeling. I hope so. Reading is great!
