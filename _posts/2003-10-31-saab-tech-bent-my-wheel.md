Get this, the Saab tech writer called me to tell me that the tech that drove my car to see if it was out of alignment fessed up and said he ran over a rock. Didn't think anything of it, but it bent my wheel. What an asshole. I told the tech writer guy that I was going to find a list of changes I wanted made in the Tech II menu that they should do for me because they messed up my car and now I don't have it all weekend and I have to drive the "lesser" 93 Linear. Still, it's miles on their car, not mine.
