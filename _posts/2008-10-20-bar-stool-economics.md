Thanks to Sean for sending this along!<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">

<blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">Suppose that every day, ten men go out for beer and the bill for all ten comes
to $100. If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go
something like this:</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The fifth would pay $1.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The sixth would pay $3.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The seventh would pay $7.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The eighth would pay $12.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The ninth would pay $18.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59.</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">So, that's what they decided to do.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
The ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the
arrangement, until on day, the owner threw them a curve. "Since you are
all such good customers," he said, "I'm going to reduce the cost of
your daily beer by $20."Drinks for the ten now cost just $80.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
The group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes so the first
four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the
other six men - the paying customers? How could they divide the $20 windfall so
that everyone would get his 'fair share?' They realized that $20 divided by six
is $3.33. But if they subtracted that from everybody's share, then the fifth
man and the sixth man would each end up being paid to drink his beer. So, the
bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man's bill by roughly
the same amount, and he proceeded to work out the amounts each should pay.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">And so:</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
The fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33%savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The seventh now pay $5 instead of $7 (28%savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% savings).</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
Each of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to
drink for free. But once outside the restaurant, the men began to compare their
savings.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
"I only got a dollar out of the $20,"declared the sixth man. He
pointed to the tenth man," but he got $10!"</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
"Yeah, that's right," exclaimed the fifth man. "I only saved a
dollar, too. It's unfair that he got ten times more than I!"</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
"That's true!!" shouted the seventh man. "Why should he get $10
back when I got only two? The wealthy get all the breaks!"</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
"Wait a minute," yelled the first four men in unison. "We didn't
get anything at all. The system exploits the poor!"</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
The nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
The next night the tenth man didn't show up for drinks, so the nine sat down
and had beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they
discovered something important. They didn't have enough money between all of
them for even half of the bill!</span></span>
<span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana; color: #333333;">
And that, boys and girls, journalists and college professors, is how our tax
system works. The people who pay the highest taxes get the most benefit from a
tax reduction. Tax them too much, attack them for being wealthy, and they just
may not show up anymore. In fact, they might start drinking overseas where the
atmosphere is somewhat friendlier.</span></span>
