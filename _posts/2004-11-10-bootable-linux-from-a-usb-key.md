Now this is totally kick ass. Thanks to Ars Technica for pointing this out to me!!!

I guess it's like having a linux distro that is bootable from a CD, like <a href="http://www.knoppix.net">Knoppix</a>, but this is much smaller. MUCH MUCH smaller.

SLAX is based off of <a href="http://www.slackware.org">Slackware </a>Linux.
