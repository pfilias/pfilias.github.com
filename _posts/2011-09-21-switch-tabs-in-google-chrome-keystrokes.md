Ever wanted to keep your hands on the keyboard and navigate your tabs in Google Chrome? Well, I try to keep my hands on the keyboard as much as possible, so I took to Google to search for this, and wallah, it led me to this info:
<blockquote><strong>To switch to the next tab:</strong>
Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+PgDown

<strong>To switch to the previous tab:</strong>
Ctrl+Shift+Tab or Ctrl+PgUp

<strong>To switch to a specific tab:</strong>
Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+8

<strong>To switch to the last tab:</strong>
Ctrl+9</blockquote>
