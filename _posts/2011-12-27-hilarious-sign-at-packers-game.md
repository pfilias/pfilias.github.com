So I was watching the Packers game with my wife, Michelle, and I caught this hilarious sign held up by a fan that said: "My Cheating EX Boyfriend is Watching from Couch Instead". I thought it was hilarious and I was happy to see it was caught by Yahoo!'s <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Best-fan-sign-of-the-year-Packers-fan-uses-game?urn=nfl-wp14705">Shutdown Corner!</a>
