You know, what we needed this week was a good, strong run! After starting the running week so late, our 8 mile run tonight was awesome! We always say we're gonna take it easy, but we always end up running nice and strong! Maybe it was the cool, dry weather, maybve it was the rested legs we had. We did 8:50 miles. It felt awesome!

Now we rest!
