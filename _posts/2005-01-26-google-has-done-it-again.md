This time, Google has a new search feature called <a href="http://video.google.com">Google Video</a>.

From their site:
<i>Our mission is to organize the world's information, and that includes the thousands of programs that play on our TVs every day. Google Video enables you to search a growing archive of televised content ? everything from sports to dinosaur documentaries to news shows.

Just type in your search term (for instance, ipod or Napa Valley) or do a more advanced search (for instance, title:nightline) and Google Video will search the closed captioning text of all the programs in our archive for relevant results. Click on a program title on your results page and you can look through short snippets of the text along with still images from the show. Visit the "About this show" side panel to learn when this show will air next.

Right now we're just testing this product, so you'll find programs only from a limited number of channels, which we've been indexing since late December 2004. You can expect to see more and more content as we continue to add new channels.

Our mission is to give viewers complete access to public affairs programming and we are committed to use new technologies to enhance the value of our services. This partnership with Google further demonstrates how new technologies will expand our audience and make it easier to conduct online searches of our content for information most relevant to them.
- Brian Lamb, C-SPAN Chairman and CEO</i>

Also, Google has released a new version of <a href="http://wwww.picasa.com">Picasa</a>, the photo album software they purchased this year. It competes directly with Adobe Photoshop Album. If you're into photos and keeping them on your PC, Picasa does an excellent job of giving you a portal to them in a nicely organized user interface. It also does an excellent job of doing simple photo edits and effects!
