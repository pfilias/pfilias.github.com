Women wearing white masks, representing exploited faceless workers, sit at sewing machines during a protest against the exploitation of workers producing the sportswear that is marketed through the Olympic Games (news - web sites), in Athens August 10, 2004. The Clean Clothes Campaign, Global Unions and Oxfam are challenging the IOC (news - web sites) and sportswear companies to accept their responsibility to stop the exploitation.
