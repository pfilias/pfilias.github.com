Happy Summer 2005!!!! Weather's been a little bit weird here this late Spring. It was really cool for a few weeks, then we got blasted with five or six 90 degree days in a row. It was super muggy, too. Then it cooled off a little bit last week with highs in the high 60s to low 70s. It's heating back up again with temps in the 80s this week and getting to 92 and thunderstorms on Friday.

I hope the weather is nice on Saturday so that we can go to and enjoy the <a href="http://www.opafest.com">Opa! Fest!</a> at St. Nick's in Troy.
