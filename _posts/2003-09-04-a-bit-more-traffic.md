Jason Dunn has done me the favor of posting my latest giveaways at Axim Users Dot Com on his site, <a href="http://www.pocketpcthoughts.com">PocketPC Thoughts.</a> They've done me well over there. Each time they mention my site on their front page, my site gets mad traffic. So far, I've got 2700+ pageviews today, which is up, significantly as of the latest few weeks of traffic, and I have 29 new registrations. I have to keep this aggressiveness up! Thanks, Jason!
