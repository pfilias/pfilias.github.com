I was messing around with del.icio.us and came across this link: <a href="http://www.dwblog.net/?p=312">Become a Photoshop Expert</a>.

As I get more interested in photography and manipulating, I see blog entries like this and they jump out at me. Now, the problem is, I need to find the time to DO some of this <ttag>Photoshop</ttag> stuff. Sometimes, <a href="http://www.picasa.com">Picasa</a> is much easier to quickly "tweak" my photos.
