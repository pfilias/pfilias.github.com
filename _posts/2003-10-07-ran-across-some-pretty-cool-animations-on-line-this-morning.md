Not sure how I found it, but check <a href="http://www.napster.com/bits/" target="_blank">this</a> out. It's some animations from Napster, demonstrating that they are on their way back. I remember now, I saw it as a skyscraper ad on a Yahoo news page. The Napster brand is so big, that whatever they do, they can make an impact, and a comeback, even if people have to PAY to use their service. Napster changed and revolutionized the music industry. I'm excited to see what they have up their sleeves!
