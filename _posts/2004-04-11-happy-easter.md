Happy Easter everyone!!! And for those of the Hebron faith, happy belated Passover! :)

Going over to my aunt Effie's (fiffy) house for a traditional Greek lamb dinner being cooked on the spit. I can't wait to see it. Before that, having an Easter brunch at the in-laws! That's always a good time. We'll get to see Kim and Matt!
