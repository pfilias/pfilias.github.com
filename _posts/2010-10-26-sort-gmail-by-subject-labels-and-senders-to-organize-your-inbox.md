<div class='posterous_autopost'><p>I was looking for a way to delete large attachments in my Gmail. Gmail doesn't offer a sort by size feature, so I figured I'd do a little Googling. It led me to this:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.gtricks.com/gmail-tricks/sort-gmail-subject-label-sender/">Sort Gmail by Subject, Labels, and Senders to Organize your Inbox</a></p>  <p>In doing that, I found this nice trick (from the page above):</p>  <blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">  <p>Though Gmail provide hundreds of thousands of inbox memory (at present  7400MB), then to you can run out of space. In such a case search for &ldquo;<strong><em>has:attachment from:me label:sent</em></strong>&rdquo; which will list mails sent by you and have a attachment. You can safely delete them to get some extra space.</p>  </blockquote></div>
