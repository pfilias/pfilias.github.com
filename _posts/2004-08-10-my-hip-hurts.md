For the first time ever, I have pain in one of my joints. For some silly reason, my left hip hurts. It usually only hurts when I get up from having been sitting for a while. Once I'm up and walking or running, no problem. So, last night, I started taking <b>flax seed oil</b>. This is supposed to help keep your joints lubricated. If that doesn't work, I guess I'll have to take <b>jointritis</b>!!
