Oh boy!!! I finally upgraded our computer room. We now both have LCD monitor and <a href="http://images2.newegg.com/productimage/56-101-217-07.JPG">Shuttle SN41G2 </a>boxes. Man, these things are pimp!!! I <b>LOVE </b>how they look and love how small they are!!!

Stay tuned. Busy getting everything nice and slick.
