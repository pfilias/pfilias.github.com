Seriously, the guys (people) over at Google are amazing.

Can they continue to amaze us with their releases of cool technology forever? I think so.

A cool tidbit my friend, JT$, sent me this morning:

<font face="Trebuchet MS" size=2>The combined market cap of GM, Ford Motor Co., Roger Penske's United Auto Group and the seven Michigan auto suppliers on the Fortune 500 -- Delphi, Visteon, Lear, American Axle, ArvinMeritor, TRW Automotive and Federal-Mogul -- is a mere $47 billion.That's 25 percent shy of the value of just one newly minted public company, Google Inc., whose market cap was $62.7 billion Wednesday.</font>

Anyway, the real reason I made this blog entry:

<a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com">Google's Web Accelerator</a>

What is it? (Taken from Google's site).

<u><b>1. What is Google Web Accelerator?</b></u>

Google Web Accelerator is an application that uses the power of Google's global computer network to make web pages load faster. Google Web Accelerator is easy to use; all you have to do is download and install it, and from then on many web pages will automatically load faster than before.

Please note that Google Web Accelerator is currently in beta test mode. If you have any problems using it or have suggestions for how we can improve it, please see the Google Group devoted to it.

Also note that during the first part of our beta testing period, users outside of North America and Europe may not see much improvement in their web page loading speed.
