Did I mention that I finally got my Klipsch ProMedia 4.1s back yesterday. I was concerned since I hadn't heard from them since I sent them back. I tracked the package I sent and saw that it made it there on August 27. My contact person there is on vacation until Sep. 9, so I thought I wouldn't hear a word. They were on my doorstep yesterday! Looks like they shipped them out on August 27, 2003. That's pretty fast. It also looks like they either gave me refurbed fronts and sub or new ones. They smelled new, unless that is what being in Styrofoam for a weak does! So, for $50, I am back in business!
