Why bother having a color screen and the ability to view photos if you don't also have built-in card slots. That's just my opinion. The article mentions using Belkins media reader, which is supposed to suck the life out of your battery before you can even empty a decent-sized CF card. The question would arise, though, if there were slots on the iPod, which ones? If you had all of them, the device would probably be too big. Convergance, that's what we need. We need a device with 1TB of storage, that's as small as a small cell phone that does everything! Music, movies, photos, email, SMS, surf the web, play games, and what else... convert speech to text!
