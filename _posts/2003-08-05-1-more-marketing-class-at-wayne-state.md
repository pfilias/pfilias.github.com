<b>Marketing:</b>
After tonight's class, we have one more, and that will be in Greektown. Supposedly, we should have a take-home final exam and we'll have to do our group 20 page paper. How tough can that be? There are 6 of us. That equates to less than 4 pages each. Can't complain about that, right?
