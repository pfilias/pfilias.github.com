Been working diligently getting product photos and information up for Vintage King Audio. Their site sure is getting somewhere over the past few months. I can't wait until it's done though, so I can rest... or will I miss it?

The other night, I overclocked the BeJesus out of my system. I am currently running stable at 9.5x194 (1844). I ran it through 10 cycles of the Sanda Burn-in wizard. It's nice to finally have a motherboard that 1) Takes high speed ram (PC3200), 2) Has a locked PCI bus (33MHz), 3) Has most everything onboard, except for video. I have been having quite a good time with it lately, as I LOVE to push it, and LOVE to run benchmarks. I was able to accomplish this by "unlocking" my Athlon XP 2000+. I got the kit from <a href="http://www.highspeedpc.com">www.highspeedpc.com</a>. What this does is allow me to run my CPU at other multipliers instead of its 12.5 that it is set at. I'm thinking that my XP2000+ sucks for overclocking, as I'm not even getting a 200MHz overclock (stable) with it. Kind of pisses me off.

Off to help Michelle with dinner. I set up the marinade earlier.
