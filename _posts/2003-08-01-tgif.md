Thank GOODNESS it's Friday! He he. So I've got this fancy new BLOG software installed on my machine, and I've got a whole weekend of excitement to look forward to, yeah right, and now I have the freedom to deal with my own server when it comes to babbling about my boring life.

<b>Wakeboarding:</b>
We went to Mike and Amy's yesterday and had the chance to go wakeboarding. Boy do I suck! It took about 8 tries for me to finally get up, and then it took about 3 more times of 1 success and 1 failure to finally get up about 3 or 4 times in a row. There are pictures at http://photos.filias.com -- under the 2003 Albums. You can see my trials and tribulations! We got to see Sean... been quite some time. He lives in Phoenix! I wish my batteries didn't die. I really wanted to take some pictures and pull some film of Mike doing some big air!!! Oh well.
