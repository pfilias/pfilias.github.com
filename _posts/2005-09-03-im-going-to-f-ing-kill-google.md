This is an awesome story. Apparently, Steve Ballmer was pretty upset when an engineer who has worked for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> for ten years told him he was going to work for <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.

<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/microsoft-ceo-im-going-to-fing-kill-google/2005/09/03/1125302772214.html">Going to kill Google!</a>

Ballmer not only made those verbal threats, but he also picked up a chair and threw it across the room!

<blockquote>"I'm going to f---ing bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again," the declaration quotes Ballmer. "I'm going to f---ing kill Google."</blockquote>

I picked this story up from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2005/9/3/1106">ArsTechnica</a>, for starters.
