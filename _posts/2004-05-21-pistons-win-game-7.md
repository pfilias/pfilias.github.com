I knew it! I knew it!

They kicked their ass!! Man, it was fun to watch, only because it was game 7. Had it been game 1 or 2, it would've sucked, if you ask me.

<u><b>Score</b></u>
Detroit: 90
New Jersey: 69

Rip Hamilton pretty much smothered Jason Kidd. Poor guy. He was held scoreless for the first time in his history of playoff games!!

Seriously, I'm glad they are back to where they were last year. As Ben Wallace said, they have to improve upon last year. Let's hope they face off against the Lakers in the NBA Finals. The Pistons deserve it, <b><a href="http://www.detroitpistons.com"><font color="#0000FF">Detroit</font></a></b> deserves it!!
