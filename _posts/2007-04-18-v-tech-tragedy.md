I am sitting here, working at a large university, thinking about the tragedy that took place 2 days ago in Blacksburg, VA. How horrendous. We're just never going to be safe, no matter where we work. It's impossible to prevent random acts of violence from happening. Take away legal guns, and that lunatic would have found one on his own or found some other means of violence to unleash. Could his insanity and anger been identified and prevented due to his strange and hateful writings? Sure, but why can't that guy just write fiction? I'm not condoning folks writing some F'd up stuff, I'm just saying... it's easy to look BACK and say you could have done this or that...at the end of the day, it was random.
