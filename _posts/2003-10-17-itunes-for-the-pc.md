Look at that! As they put it on their front page, Apple released iTunes for Windows! As they put it: <B>Hell Froze Over!</B> Kind of funny.

I'm installing it now as we speak. Give it a shot. When I get rich again, maybe I'll get myself an iPod. They also released some peripherals yesterday from Belkin that do some very nice things. They released some hardware that allows you to voice record << ho hum. But the really cool thing is the media card reader they installed. Now THAT rocks. You can be on vacation, taking pictures left and right, and have nearly unlimited space to dump the pictures and movies on to! Bye bye other devices that used to do the same thing! Dino has one of these things from MindWorks. Really helped me out in the past, but this is amazing!
