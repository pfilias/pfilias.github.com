It?s the 15th of November.   That means it is Saint Gertrude Day.  I try to read from the Pictorial Lives of the Saints book each day.  I find it puts me in a good frame of mind.  I then try to follow up with a passage/chapter from the Bible.  I am not on Daniel.  Shadrach, Meshiac and Ibidnigo and the fiery furnace.  What I find funny is the distinction of patron saint for the Day; again, Saint Gertrude for today?s date.  Now, say one was of such piety, do they consider the patron saint of the day as they near expiration on earth. 

?Looking at the upcoming week ? it?s a tough one , St. Peter, St. Gertrude, St. Michael, St. Theresa, and St. Patrick.  I can?t break into that crowd.  Well, maybe could compete with St. Gertrude ? but that?s it!  If I don?t expire on Tuesday, I will have to hold out for a bit!?  

Certainly a tough club to join.  But I guess at that point of the game, intervention is going to step in where needed anyway.
