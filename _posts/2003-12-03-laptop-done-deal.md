Oh yeah, Michelle and I are buying that laptop! After two nights of WiFi grief, I got it solved! Guess what my problems were? I had to unplug my router/wap from the wall and plug it back in. Go figure! Well, the machine is great. I ordered the proper ac adapter from my favorite computer company, Gateway, as well as ordering a 512MB soDIMM from Newegg.com. It'll give the machine a total of 768MB of ram. Should be fine. Now I just have to see if I can find a Radeon Mobility 9000 that I can swap INTO this thing.
