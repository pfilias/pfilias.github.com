Yesterday, at Benjamin's 4th birthday party, he said one of the funniest things in quite some time!

He was opening gifts and he got two Bakugan Battle Brawler carry cases that are these little plastic cases that hold 15 or so Bakugan Battle Brawlers. He said, "Awesome, I got 2 of these. One for me and one for me!"
