Michelle and I had our best 9 mile run, ever!!! I felt like a horse tonight. It was about 60 degrees, with practically ANY humidity in the air! We did 9.017 miles in 1:19:xx. It ended up being 8:51 pace. I felt awesome. It was like CRUISE CONTROL the entire way! HOOOO AH!

Oh yeah, did the last mile in 7:58!
