My Uncle John Pappadopoulos in Greece has 3 clogged arteries. 90%, 85%, and 80%. Angioplasty is out. He's home now, but needs to get bypass surgery. Dirty Greek medical system. He had to pay $500 just to get his catheterization read. He'll have to fork out about $5000 to have the surgery. This is above and beyond what their insurance and social health care takes care of.
