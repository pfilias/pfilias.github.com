I always find it funny that on http://store.apple.com, the image that says "We'll be back soon", when they are making changes to their store, is being resized via HTML and not natively the right size, so it always looks "dirty"... Right click that image and choose to "View Image", and you'll see how it's SUPPOSED to look.<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://images.apple.com/r/store/backsoon/title_backsoon1.gif" width="516" /><br /><br />The way I have it in this blog is how they have it on their store page as of right now.<br /><br />This is how it's supposed to look:<br /><br /><img style="max-width: 800px;" src="http://images.apple.com/r/store/backsoon/title_backsoon1.gif" />
