She admitted today that her claim to the winning Mega Millions ticket was false. What a loser! What an outrage. I wonder how much money her false claim cost, overall? This would include police and other law enforcement authorities, news coverage, etc.... I could only imagine it'd have costed 10s of thousands of dollars, mayben even 100s of thousands.

Now, THIS lady:

Is pretty tight. I'm glad she won. She's all put together.
