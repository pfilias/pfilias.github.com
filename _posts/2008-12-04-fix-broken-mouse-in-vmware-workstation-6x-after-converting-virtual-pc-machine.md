I recently switched from Virtual PC 2007 from Microsoft, which is free, to VMWare Workstation 6.5. I thought Virtual PC was nice, but it wasn't fast enough and gave me problems when trying to copy files from the guest OS to the host OS.

I used the VMWare Converter to convert the VPC machine but it wouldn't recognize my mouse. I found this excellent post about a fix and wanted to share it.
