They just called and said they had <b><i>mismeasured </i></b>a few months ago when they found out I could get my tires (2 of them) replaced per this program with Pirelli and pay 46 per tire. They are at 5/32 and 8/32 (back and front) on wear. They need to be 3/32. So I have taken my car there, wasting my time on a number of occasions. What can I do?

So by the time they are worn at 3/32, it'll probably be past the 15,000 mile mark where they prorate and give you a break on tires, and new tires will cost a fortune.
