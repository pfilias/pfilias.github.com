Even though I ended up doing a 10:41 pace, the 16 mile run wasn't very fun. The last four miles were grueling! The reason: <b>ALCOHOL</b>!!! Michelle wasn't affected by it because she was <b>hyrdating </b>herself like a good little runner on Saturday. Me, I was hydrating myself with <b>Smirnoff Twisted Green Apple and Labatt's Blue Light! </b>I felt great, though, the first 10-12 miles... I had no intentions of feeling fatigue, elevated heart rate, and stiffness in my muscles and joints...but I did, damnit! I most certainly did! Lesson: hydrate yourself, <b>ALWAYS</b>, when you have a long run ahead of you. Idiotic NOT to!
