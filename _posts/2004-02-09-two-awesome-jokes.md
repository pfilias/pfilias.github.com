My buddy, Kevin, sent me these. I've only included two of the five he sent.

<i><b>Number 4
</b>A  businessman boards a flight and is seated next to a gorgeous woman. He
notices she is reading a manual about sexual statistics... He  asks her
about  it and she replies, "This is a very  interesting book. It says that
American  Indians  have the longest penises and Greek men are the best in
bed.  By  the way, my name is Jill. What's yours?"  "Tonto Papadopoulos,
nice to meet you."</i>

<i><b>Number 2
</b>Bill worked in a pickle  factory. He had been employed there for a number
of years when he came home one day to confess to his wife that  he had
terrible compulsion. He had an urge to  stick his penis into the pickle
slicer.  His  wife  suggested that he should see a sex therapist to talk
about it, but Bill said he would be too embarrassed. He vowed to overcome
the  compulsion on his own.  One day a few weeks  later, Bill came home.
His wife could see at once that  something was seriously wrong.  "What's
wrong, Bill?" she  asked.  "Do you remember that I told you how I had this
tremendous urge to put  my  penis into the pickle  slicer?"
"Oh, Bill, you didn't."
"Yes, I did."
"My God, Bill, what happened?"
"I got fired."  "No, Bill. I mean, what happened with the pickle slicer?"
"Oh...she got fired too."</i>
