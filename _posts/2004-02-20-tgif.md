Ran 30
Chest

Feeling kind of weak... like my body is fighting a cold/respiratory infection. I gotta shake it so that my trip to NYC is flawless. :D

Still gotta watch 1 1/2 hours of lecture tonight and at least two hours of lecture tomorrow before I head out... that's what the weekends are like...school. I almost don't want to take online classes anymore so that I can have my weekends freed up!
