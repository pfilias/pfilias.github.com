R.I.P. Steve "The Crocodile Hunter" Irwin.

He was attacked by a stingray off the Great Barrier Reef in Australia on September 4, 2006. A stingray's barb went through his heart. I heard on the news this morning that his manager and longtime friend saw the footage and said it was "shocking". Steve actually pulled the barb out of his chest and died shortly after! WOW...that is absolutely crazy!
