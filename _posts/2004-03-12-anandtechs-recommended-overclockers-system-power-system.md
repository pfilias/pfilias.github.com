More or less, <a href="http://anandtech.com/guides/showdoc.html?i=1992&p=9">this sytem</a> is about all you'd need for the next year or so if you're an avid upgrader/overclocker. It's a pretty damn nice system if you ask me. Me, I'm pretty happy w/ my Shuttle setup...but I could be looking at doing some upgrades in the next year or so. My gaming has gone from rare to even MORE RARE! So, I'm not sure if my statement on upgrade options is accurate or not. Maybe I'm just crazy and like blogging!

<b>A week from now...</b>
I'll be shredding down the mountain with my good friends, Sean and Dave. I can't wait!
