I was reading <a href="http://www.freep.com/sports/albom/mitch12_20040612.htm">Mitch Albom's story</a> about Ben Wallace, and came across this and thought I'd share it with you.

<em>The other day, I asked Dumars if he were worried that the Pistons, following their Game 1 victory, might be out partying late in Los Angeles. After all, they were a Midwest team staying in a Beverly Hills hotel.

Dumars laughed. "When I got back to the hotel, I saw Ben Wallace pushing a stroller down the street, and he and his wife were trying to find something to eat. I knew right then I didn't have to worry."</em>

I think that's awesome! You'd actually think the Pistons, or any group of guys, would be out, enjoying the weather, enjoying LA, etc. How cool.
