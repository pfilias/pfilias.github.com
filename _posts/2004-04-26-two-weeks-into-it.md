And I've lost 10.4 pounds. I'm thrilled. I'm a bit apprehensive about it though, as it's a bit TOO MUCH, TOO FAST. However, my summer of marathon training ahead of me should keep it off and keep it COMING OFF! Toot toot! Naaah.

I'm just excited to see if I can get to a lower weight than I was the previous two summers.
